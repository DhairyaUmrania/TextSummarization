    "Women education is a catch all term which refers to the state of primary, secondary, tertiary and health education in girls and women. There are 65 Million girls out of school across the globe; majority of them are in the developing and underdeveloped countries. All the countries of the world, especially the developing and underdeveloped countries must take necessary steps to improve their condition of female education; as women can play a vital role in the nation’s development.\n",
    "If we consider society as tree, then men are like its strong main stem which supports the tree to face the elements and women are like its roots; most important of them all. The stronger the roots are the bigger and stronger the tree will be spreading its branches; sheltering and protecting the needy.\n",
    "Women are the soul of a society; a society can well be judged by the way its women are treated. An educated man goes out to make the society better, while an educated woman; whether she goes out or stays at home, makes the house and its occupants better.\n",
    "Women play many roles in a society- mother, wife, sister, care taker, nurse etc. They are more compassionate towards the needs of others and have a better understanding of social structure. An educated mother will make sure that her children are educated, and will weigh the education of a girl child, same as boys.\n",
    "History is replete with evidences, that the societies in which women were treated equally to men and were educated; prospered and grew socially as well as economically. It will be a mistake to leave women behind in our goal of sustainable development, and it could only be achieved if both the genders are allowed equal opportunities in education and other areas.\n",
    "Education makes women more confident and ambitious; they become more aware of their rights and can raise their voice against exploitation and violence. A society cannot at all progress if its women weep silently. They have to have the weapon of education to carve out a progressive path for their own as well as their families.\n",

It remains a competitive advantage in working with\\nlocal councils, the planning process, affordable housing\\npartnerships, acquiring land and selling homes.”\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:54  Page 7 07     annual report and accounts 2008\\nchairman’s statement\\n“Telford Homes has\\ncontinued to make good\\nprogress during the last\\n12 months and once\\nagain I am reporting on\\na record year in which\\nour financial targets\\nhave been exceeded.”\\nDavid Holland \\nChairman (Non-Executive)\\nThe Company’s strategy is to pre-sell\\nproperties as early as possible, in many cases\\nbefore construction has commenced, and a\\nnumber of successful sales launches have\\ncontributed to this aim of reducing risk in the\\nbusiness. At 31st March 2008 unrecognised\\nrevenue secured by contracts exchanged was\\n£125 million, higher than ever before. Our\\nstrategy has put us in a very strong position\\nin the face of a weakening market. \\nSince last summer the Company has been\\nmore cautious when investing in new land\\ngiven the restricted availability and higher\\ncosts of mortgage finance for homebuyers\\nand the impact this had on consumer\\nconfidence. This prudent approach will\\ncontinue. Funds have been retained for\\ninvestment in our partnerships with housing\\ntransfer organisations but other land\\npurchases will be restricted to those where\\nthe initial cash outflow is limited or cash\\ninflows from the development are secured. \\nWe expect trading conditions to improve\\nwhen restrictions ease in the mortgage\\nmarket although it is not clear when this will\\noccur. There remains a need to increase the\\nsupply of new homes over the next few years\\nand this, together with ongoing growth and\\nregeneration in East London, underpins the\\nfuture success of Telford Homes. \\nDavid Holland\\nChairman (Non-Executive)\\n27th May 2008\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:54  Page 8 annual report and accounts 2008     08\\nbusiness & financial review\\nComputer \\ngenerated image of \\nGreenwich Creekside, SE8\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:54  Page 9 chief executive’s review\\n“An excellent performance\\nin the first six months of\\nthe year continued into\\nthe second half despite\\nincreasingly difficult market\\nconditions. Revenue has\\ngrown by 54% to £160.4\\nmillion and profit before tax\\nis up 31% to £17.7 million.”\\nAndrew Wiseman\\nChief Executive\\nThis has been achieved as a result of the\\nstrength of the Telford Homes brand,\\nincorporating realistic pricing and consistent\\ndelivery, together with strong marketing\\nconcepts which have allowed the Company to\\ncontinue selling homes to the investor market\\nat an early stage in the development process. \\nProperty sales and affordable housing\\nContracts were exchanged on 523 open\\nmarket private homes, 502 affordable\\nhomes and ten commercial units, making\\na total of 1,035 properties in the year.\\nIncluded within this number are 230 homes\\nbeing constructed under joint ventures\\nwhere we recognise half of the revenue\\nand profit from the development. \\nWhere the market allows we maintain\\nour policy of de-risking the business by\\ncontracting sales before much of the\\ndevelopment work on each site has taken\\nplace. This secures future cash flows and has\\nled to extended bank finance on a number\\nof developments where the volume of sales\\noffsets the risk of increased gearing. In total\\nwe had 2,051 properties under construction at\\n31st March 2008 of which 73% were secured\\nby contracts exchanged. \\nThe number of open market private homes\\nsold has increased by 9% this year with\\nthe average selling price of those homes\\nincreasing to £264,000 from £258,000.\\nSuccessful sales launches during the year\\ninclude the sale of all 161 open market\\nhomes at Merchants’ Quarter on the British\\nEstate, E3; Stadthaus, N1 where all 19 open\\nmarket homes were sold in November 2007;\\nVellum in Walthamstow where contracts\\nhave been exchanged on 24 of 66 open\\nmarket homes and Kinetica, E8 where 25 of\\n41 have been secured. Vellum and Kinetica\\nwere launched in the first few months of\\n2008 and reservations are still being taken\\nat these developments. Handovers of the\\ncompleted homes will take place in 2010,\\nby which time our investors anticipate that\\nthe market will have recovered.\\nIn contrast expected handover dates for the first\\nand second phases at Queen Mary’s Gate \\nin South Woodford are all during 2008. \\nThis development has been the Company’s\\n09     annual report and accounts 2008\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:54  Page 10 business & financial review\\nannual report and accounts 2008     10\\nQueen Mary’s Gate,\\nSouth Woodford, E18\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:54  Page 11 Icona, Stratford, E15\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:54  Page 12 business & financial review\\nmost significant sales outlet during the year\\nwith properties largely for the owner-occupier\\nmarket. The first phase is 93% sold with 172\\nout of 184 open market homes secured and\\nover 150 legally completed and occupied.\\nThe second phase is due to be completed\\nin November 2008 and contracts have been\\nexchanged on 18 of 93 open market\\nhomes with a further one reserved. \\nWhilst properties for the owner-occupier\\nmarket are less likely to sell at an early\\nstage, the rate of sale has significantly\\nslowed at Queen Mary’s Gate. Without\\nimprovement in the current market\\nconditions we expect to be carrying a\\nnumber of completed homes for sale\\non this development into 2009 and the\\nCompany is budgeting on this basis. \\nThe number of affordable homes sold has\\nincreased to 502 from 84 last year, partly\\nreflecting the timing of some significant\\ncontracts. Partnerships with affordable\\nhousing providers remain integral to\\nour business and typically 35% of any\\ndevelopment is sold for affordable housing. \\nThese partnerships are even more\\nsignificant in the current climate and\\nwe will continue to be active in seeking\\nopportunities where an increased level\\nof affordable housing reduces the open\\nmarket risk in a development. \\nOur development at Papermill Place in\\nWalthamstow incorporates 175 homes being\\nconstructed for East Thames Housing Group\\nfor £19.3 million as well as 66 open market\\nhomes being marketed as Vellum. This mix of\\nhomes improves the return on equity from\\nthe development and secures cash inflows\\nover the course of construction in return for\\na lower anticipated margin. In total at \\n31st March 2008 amounts due under\\naffordable housing contracts over the next\\nfew years were in excess of £60 million. \\nCompletions\\nConsumer confidence in the national\\nhousing market has been hit in recent\\nmonths by the reduced availability and\\nhigher cost of mortgage finance.\\nRestrictions on mortgage finance make\\nthe process of legally completing finished\\nproperties more protracted. \\nTelford Homes is communicating with\\neach purchaser to ensure their financial\\narrangements have been instigated at an\\nearly enough stage to meet our completion\\ndates. In addition we have been in dialogue\\nwith some of the major lenders and valuers\\nto maximise confidence through\\ntransparency of information. The \\nTelford Homes approach to sales is based \\non net prices agreed at the point of sale \\nwith no undisclosed discounts or incentives\\ndistorting true valuations. \\nIn the last six months we have legally\\ncompleted more than 300 open market\\nhomes at Icona in Stratford and \\nQueen Mary’s Gate with a quarter of these\\nin the past eight weeks. Although some have\\ntaken slightly longer than usual to complete\\nthere have only been a few serious issues; on\\ntwo occasions we rescinded contracts with\\nthe buyer and retained the 10% deposit. One\\nof these properties was immediately resold\\nand completed, the other was rescinded in\\nApril 2008 and is expected to be resold at no\\nless than the original purchase price. \\nDespite the problems in the mortgage\\nmarket, our performance on completions\\nto date coupled with our early dialogue\\nwith customers due to complete later in\\n2008 means that we remain confident that\\nthe projected cash inflows from exchanged\\nproperties will be realised. \\nannual report and accounts 2008     12\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:54  Page 13 Site acquisitions\\nThe Company has reduced its investment\\nin the development pipeline over the last\\nfew months in response to a climate of\\ncontinuing uncertainty in the housing\\nmarket and the economy. Protection of\\ncash has become our immediate priority\\nand we are therefore appraising sites\\nwhich have lower up-front net equity\\nrequirements including joint ventures and\\npartnerships with housing associations. \\nOur most recent acquisition is a parcel of\\nfive sites in Southwark in partnership with\\nFamily Mosaic Housing Association which\\nare expected to deliver over 100 new\\nhomes. There are no initial land payments\\nfrom Telford Homes and the expected\\nproceeds will be shared with Family Mosaic\\nunder the terms of the agreement. Three\\nof the sites are already under construction\\nand the other two are subject to receipt of\\nfull planning permission. \\nPlanning\\nThe planning process remains a significant\\nbarrier to the efficient delivery of new homes\\nin London. We retain a competitive advantage\\nthrough our knowledge of the local planning\\nenvironment in East London and this puts us\\nin a strong position. During the year we have\\nhad a number of successes including full\\nplanning permission for the 371 homes at\\nGreenwich Creekside, our joint venture with\\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland, and for 360\\nhomes in Bethnal Green Road, our joint\\nventure with Genesis Housing Group. \\nIncreasing bureaucracy and the need to satisfy\\nseveral different bodies with competing views\\nhave led to delays in the development of\\nsome sites which are expected to be under\\nconstruction during 2008. Two of our\\ndevelopments await appeal decisions which, if\\nallowed, will mean work can commence later\\nthis year. Overall the number of units in the\\ndevelopment pipeline that are subject to the\\nplanning process has reduced to 25% of the\\ntotal pipeline from 42% last year. \\nchief executive’s review\\n13     annual report and accounts 2008\\nCosmopolitan Apartments,\\nEnfield\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 14 business & financial review\\nDevelopment pipeline and partnerships\\nOur development pipeline, being properties\\nthat will produce profit in future years\\nexcluding those built for joint venture\\npartners, consists of 1,388 properties with\\nplanning permission and 454 subject to the\\nplanning process. This is a total of 1,842\\nproperties which are expected to provide\\nturnover in excess of £430 million and\\ngross profit of over £80 million. \\nAlthough we have reduced our investment\\nin new land, we have retained financial\\nresources to deploy in our partnerships\\nwith Eastend Homes and Poplar HARCA.\\nThese housing transfer organisations are\\nboth significant land owners in East\\nLondon and have chosen Telford Homes\\nto be their partner on a number of large\\nregeneration schemes. \\nFollowing the success of our partnership with\\nEastend Homes on the British Estate, E3, we\\nhave now submitted plans for the St George’s\\nEstate, E1 and we continue to progress master\\nplans for the regeneration of five other\\nestates. The British Estate has set the model\\nfor this partnership with land payments made\\nby Telford Homes being reinvested into the\\nthird party refurbishment of existing homes\\non the estate. In total the partnership with\\nEastend Homes is expected to add in excess of\\n1,000 properties to the development pipeline\\nand the partnership with Poplar HARCA is\\nexpected to add over 400 properties. \\nIn further recognition of our contribution\\nto the supply of affordable housing we\\nwere chosen as a pre-qualified partner\\nof the Housing Corporation during 2007.\\nThis enables the Company to bid directly for\\ngrant funding and gives us greater influence\\nin the provision of new affordable housing. \\nannual report and accounts 2008     14\\nComputer\\ngenerated image of\\nBethnal Green Road, E1\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 15 chief executive’s review\\n15     annual report and accounts 2008\\nOperating performance\\nThe operational output of the business\\ncontinues to grow and we have over 3,000\\nproperties either in the planning process, in\\ndetailed design or under construction. There\\nare now three operating divisions managing\\ndelivery, following the formation of Strada\\nearlier this year to join Alto and Metro. In\\nmany ways it is business as usual in the\\noperational management of the development\\npipeline and it will remain so if we continue\\nto be successful in selling our homes at an\\nearly stage in the development process. \\nHealth and Safety remains at the forefront\\nof our business and we have continued to\\ndevelop and monitor our policies and\\nprocedures during the year. \\nPeople\\nStaff numbers have risen in the last 12\\nmonths to manage increasing activity.\\nWe will maintain and expand this\\ninfrastructure to deliver our properties\\nwhilst we are able to secure the cash\\ninflows from their development.

Our developments with\\ncompletion dates 12 months or more into\\nthe future continue to attract buyers’\\ninterest confirming long term confidence.\\nQueen Mary’s Gate, still with availability\\nand completing later in 2008, has seen a\\nsignificant slowdown in sales in the past\\nfew months due to short term concerns. \\nWe will time sales launches at Greenwich\\nCreekside and Bethnal Green Road to get\\nthe best results in light of prevailing market\\nconditions; both of these developments are\\ndue for completion in 2011. Reflecting our\\nhigh percentage of pre-sales at 31st March\\n2008 we have made only a handful of sales\\nsince the end of the year with no new\\nlaunches and relatively little marketing\\nactivity taking place during this period. \\nRecent figures from the Department for\\nCommunities and Local Government show\\nthat the supply of new homes is not going\\nto meet current government targets in the\\nshort term. New housing starts for the three\\nmonths to March 2008 were 32,100 against\\nan annual target of 240,000. Ongoing tighter\\nterms for mortgage finance will further\\nrestrict new starts as developers will not\\nconstruct properties that cannot be sold.\\nThe imbalance between the supply of new\\nhomes and the need for somewhere to live is\\nincreasingly evident and the rental market in\\nEast London is growing steadily as a result. \\nThe Company is in a strong position both\\nto withstand the current market and to\\nbenefit once conditions begin to improve.\\nOur strategy in previous years of pre-selling \\nis now paying off and as at 31st March 2008\\nrevenue secured but not yet recognised was\\n£125 million, up from £91 million at the\\nsame time last year. \\nWe are cautious in our approach to the new\\nfinancial year, but the need for new housing\\nin East London, together with an ongoing\\nprogramme of regeneration, our brand’s\\nreputation and our beneficial partnerships\\nwith affordable housing providers, gives me\\nconfidence that the medium to longer term\\noutlook for Telford Homes remains positive. \\nAndrew Wiseman\\nChief Executive\\n27th May 2008\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 17 financial review\\n“Telford Homes has produced\\nanother year of record revenue\\nand profit during a period\\nof increasing uncertainty.\\nIn response to the change\\nin market conditions the\\nCompany is taking a prudent\\napproach to its deployment\\nof cash for land acquisition.”\\nJonathan Di-Stefano \\nFinancial Director\\nThe protection of cash balances and the\\nappropriate funding of the business must\\nbe key priorities in the current climate. \\nOperating results\\nRevenue increased to £160.4 million from\\n£104.4 million last year. An analysis of\\nproperties sold in the year is given in the\\nChief Executive’s review. \\nGross profit has increased to £33.6 million\\nwith the margin falling to 20.9% from\\n22.4% last year. This fall is partly due to a\\nnumber of developments where the cash\\nprofile results in higher returns on equity\\nbalanced during the site appraisal by a\\nreduced margin. Each new site is appraised\\nto achieve a gross margin of at least 20%\\nunless high returns on equity can be\\nsecured either through deferred land\\npayments or early revenue receipts. \\nQueen Mary’s Gate in South Woodford was\\npurchased for consideration of 35% of all\\nprivate sales proceeds achieved from the\\ndevelopment. The total expected payments\\nnow exceed £35 million with only £14\\nmillion paid up to 31st March 2008, resulting\\nin a high rate of return on equity. The profit\\nmargin on our share of sales proceeds is in\\nexcess of 20% as this represents our risk in\\nthe development. However, the reported\\nmargin is 14% when taking the proceeds\\nbeing paid directly to the vendor into\\naccount, still in line with our original\\nexpectations for the site. The gross margin in\\n2008 excluding Queen Mary’s Gate is 22.6%,\\ndown from 23.5% last year. \\nThe operational teams continue to monitor\\nand control development costs in a period\\nthat has seen significant cost pressures\\nparticularly for some raw materials. Cost\\ncontingencies cover much of this inflation\\nand careful management will be required\\ngoing forward to minimise the impact on\\nmargin in a period when increasing costs\\nwill not be offset by increasing sales values. \\n17     annual report and accounts 2008\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 18 business & financial review\\nannual report and accounts 2008     18\\nShowhome interiors at\\nQueen Mary’s Gate,\\nSouth Woodford, E18\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 19 Some of these pressures are likely to be\\nalleviated in the current market but it\\nwill take time for this to manifest itself in\\nsubcontract tender prices. Our commercial\\nteams are focused on achieving cost savings\\nin the coming months. Total build costs in\\nthe year to 31st March 2008 were \\n£76 million up from £50 million last year. \\nThe operating margin has fallen to 15.8%\\nfrom 16.0% with overheads reducing as a\\npercentage of revenue to 5.1% from 6.4%\\nlast year. Overheads remain controlled given\\nthe need to recruit adequately to manage\\nthe increasing number of properties in\\ndesign and under construction. \\nInterest\\nInterest charged in the year was £8.1 million,\\nup from £4.0 million last year in line with\\nour expectations. This reflects a significant\\nincrease in activity on site during the year\\ntogether with the impact of investing funds\\nfrom the 2006 share placing in new\\ndevelopment sites where bank finance\\nprovides 70% of the cash requirement. \\nInterest received in the year was \\n£0.5 million, down from £0.8 million last\\nyear as a result of lower average cash\\nbalances following the investment of the\\nplacing funds. Pressure on finance costs has\\nbeen alleviated to some extent by the\\nrecent reductions in the base rate. The\\nmajority of the Company’s bank finance is\\nlinked to the base rate with some exposure\\nto LIBOR linked funding in one of our\\njointly controlled entities. \\nAll of our facilities with The Royal Bank\\nof Scotland and Barclays Bank are at base\\nrate plus margins of 1.5% to 1.75%\\ndepending on whether each site has\\nplanning permission. The Company has\\nrecently negotiated a £33 million\\ndevelopment facility with The Royal Bank\\nof Scotland for Greenwich Creekside at\\nbase rate plus 1.5% and these rates are\\nstill being achieved thanks to our strong\\nrelationships and proven track record in\\nachieving sales.\\nOur revolving facility with Allied Irish Bank\\nis renegotiated on an annual basis each\\nApril and whilst the bank is borrowing at\\nLIBOR they are moving away from any base \\nfinancial review\\n19     annual report and accounts 2008\\nOneStratford,\\nStratford, E15\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 20 business & financial review\\nannual report and accounts 2008     20\\nIcona, Stratford, E15\\nrate linked funding. In this context we have\\nnegotiated base rate plus usual margins\\nplus an additional 0.5% while three month\\nLIBOR remains more than 0.5% over base\\nrate. Essentially this caps the additional\\nLIBOR liability at 0.5% whilst the current\\ndifferential is nearer to 0.9%. \\nInterest cover was 3.6 times in 2008 which\\nremains well within acceptable limits. \\nDividends\\nThe board proposes a final dividend of 5.5\\npence per ordinary share. Together with\\nthe interim dividend of 4.5 pence paid in\\nJanuary 2008, this will give a total dividend\\nfor the year of 10.0 pence which is covered\\n3.3 times by earnings per share. The total\\ndividend last year was 8.9 pence. \\nThe final dividend is expected to be paid\\non 18th July 2008 to shareholders on the\\nregister on 27th June 2008. \\nThe board’s dividend policy is to maintain the\\nlevel of cover at around 3.3 times in order to\\nachieve an appropriate mix between profits\\nreturned to shareholders and those reinvested\\nin the business. At all times the Company\\nmonitors expected cash flows to ensure that\\nthis dividend can be accommodated within\\ncurrent and future resources. \\nEarnings per share\\nEarnings per share increased to 33.3 pence\\nfrom 29.4 pence and the weighted average\\nnumber of shares in issue was 37.0 million\\nup from 32.8 million shares because the\\nshares issued in the October 2006 placing\\nhad a full year weighting. \\nBalance sheet\\nNet assets have increased to £64.2 million\\nfrom £54.8 million and net assets per share\\nat 31st March 2008 were 171 pence, up\\nfrom 148 pence last year. \\nThe placing funds raised in 2006 have been\\nallocated to new land opportunities and we\\nhave reserved some equity for investment\\nover the next two years in our partnerships\\nwith housing transfer organisations. Some of\\nthe sites purchased with the placing funds will\\ntake time to flow into revenue as they have\\nonly just received planning permission or are\\nstill going through the planning process. \\nPre-tax return on equity in the year ended 31st\\nMarch 2008 was 30.0%, falling from 31.2% last\\nyear partly as a result of the weighting of the\\nadditional equity raised in late 2006.\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 21 financial review\\n21     annual report and accounts 2008\\nQueen Mary’s Gate, South Woodford, E18\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 22 business & financial review\\nFinance\\nThe Company uses loan finance to acquire\\ndevelopment land and undertake site\\nconstruction and facilities are in place with\\nthree banks secured by a debenture over\\nthe assets of the Company and by charges\\nover the development sites owned by the\\nCompany.

There were no\\nsignificant changes in accounting required\\nas a result of the Company adopting IFRS.\\nFuture change in accounting policy\\nThe International Financial Reporting\\nInterpretations Committee (IFRIC) has\\nrecently concluded lengthy deliberations\\non the accounting treatment for real estate\\nsales. Their proposed amendment to the\\naccounting required under IFRS will mean\\nthat Telford Homes will have to account for\\nrevenue and profit from open market private\\nsales on legal completion of each property.\\nCurrently revenue and profit for all properties\\nis recognised from the point of exchange of\\ncontracts and then on a percentage complete\\nbasis. The accounting for affordable homes\\nsold under construction contracts will remain\\nunchanged. This proposal is expected to be\\nagreed in June 2008 and would be effective\\nfor the year ended 31st March 2010. The\\nmethod of accounting will not change the\\nfinancial health or day to day operation of\\nthe business but will have a significant impact\\non reported revenue and profit in each year\\nand the Company will assess this over the\\nnext few months. \\nJonathan Di-Stefano\\nFinancial Director \\n27th May 2008\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 24 Estilo, N1\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 25 Telford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 26 operating review\\nconstruction\\n“Telford Homes has over 3,000 properties going through the\\nplanning process, in detailed design or being developed.\\nJust over 2,000 of these are under construction and\\n73% are already sold with contracts exchanged.”\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 27 area of operation\\nTelford Homes is all about East\\nLondon.

This confidence is heavily influenced by factors such\\nas interest rates, the availability of mortgage finance, rental incomes, unemployment and consumer\\ncosts for other goods and services. All of these are outside of the Company’s control.\\nThe Company’s policy has been to sell early in the development process, wherever possible, to minimise the\\nrisk in each site. This policy has been very successful to date with 73% of properties under construction at\\n31st March 2008 secured by exchange of contracts. In addition the Sales and Marketing team have detailed\\nknowledge of the local market and are able to formulate the best sales strategy for each development and\\nto work with purchasers and prospective purchasers to ensure that all stages of the process from reservation\\nto legal completion run smoothly.\\nLand acquisition\\nThe Company needs new land to maintain a development pipeline and enable the business to continue\\nto operate at a certain capacity. This land needs to be sourced in appropriate locations and where optimum\\nplanning consents can be obtained. The appraisal process that determines the price paid for land is critical\\nin maintaining margins and return on equity at acceptable levels. \\nThe Land Acquisition and Partnerships teams are responsible for sourcing land and our strong relationships\\nwith various land owners including local councils and affordable housing providers play a key role in our\\nability to acquire new sites. In particular our existing partnerships with housing transfer organisations are\\nexpected to be a significant source of land in the next few years. The appraisal process for new sites includes\\ndue diligence by an experienced solicitor and authorisation of all prospective purchases at appropriate levels.\\nHealth and Safety\\nConstruction sites are dangerous places and there are many different health and safety risks to consider.\\nThe health and safety of everyone associated with Telford Homes, both employees and sub-contractors, is\\nthe first priority of the Company.\\nInvestment in training, the promotion of health and safety to all employees and extensive policies\\nand procedures all contribute to a comprehensive approach to health and safety management with\\nthe objective of minimising risk and providing a safe working environment. \\nPlanning process\\nThe flow of properties through the development pipeline is dependent on achieving suitable planning\\npermission on sites purchased without planning or subject to planning. The process is time consuming and\\ninvolves an increasing number of supporting reports and detailed consultations with many different bodies.\\nDelays in achieving suitable planning permissions affect the number of properties that can be brought to\\nmarket and impact on future timing of cash flows. Failure to achieve a suitable planning permission may\\nlead to cost write offs or reduced margins on individual developments.\\nThe Company has extensive knowledge of local planning requirements, excellent relationships with\\nplanning authorities and takes care in the appointment of professional architects, planning consultants\\nand engineers. Early consultations with the planning authorities are a key part of the land acquisition\\nprocess. While this cannot remove planning risks it mitigates them as much as possible. The Company has\\n454 properties in the development pipeline going through the planning process reduced from 942 last year.\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:56  Page 32 Construction\\nThe construction process is critical to the efficient and timely delivery of properties to purchasers which affects\\nboth cash flow and customer satisfaction. The quality of the construction work and finish in each property\\naffects the reputation of the Company and can impact on repeat purchase and recommendation rates.\\nStandards of construction and control of the building process on site are of paramount importance to each\\noperating division. Careful planning is required to assess a development programme before construction\\ncommences and this is monitored over the course of the building work. The construction teams work very\\nclosely with the Customer Service team and their interaction commences at an early stage in the development.\\nThe Customer Service team spend a substantial proportion of their time on site carrying out quality control\\nbefore a purchaser sees the property for the first time. Over 90% of surveyed customers who took ownership\\nof a Telford Homes property in 2007 would recommend the Company to their friends and family.\\nAvailability of materials and labour\\nThe availability of materials and sub-contracted labour for each site can affect both the construction\\nprogramme and the cost of construction. Build cost inflation will impact directly on the margin achieved\\non each site where this is in excess of forecasts.\\nPlanning of the construction programme and timely management of the tender process for each sub-contracted\\ntrade reduces the risk of delays in the construction programme due to availability of materials and labour. The\\ntender process ensures that competitive rates are achieved on every trade. Telford Homes works in partnership\\nwith all of its sub-contractors and makes timely payments to encourage an equal relationship that is beneficial\\nto all parties.\\nPolitical environment\\nChanges in laws and regulations can have a direct impact on the efficient running of the Company\\nand the costs incurred on each development. Changes in both local and national government can\\nhave a direct bearing on the regulatory environment.\\nThe Company works closely with specialist consultants to ensure that it is up to date with current\\nregulations and aware of any future changes so that operations can be planned accordingly. \\nCash requirements and bank finance\\nProperty development is a capital intensive business with significant initial outlays supported by bank finance\\nand lengthy time periods before the majority of the cash inflows on each project. Forecasting of cash flows is\\ncritical to ensure the Company is not operating above its financial capacity. Part of this process involves the\\nforecasting of bank funding required for each development and the availability of sufficient bank finance is\\ntherefore also of critical importance.\\nThe Company maintains a detailed cash flow forecast as part of its management information systems. This\\nextends five years into the future and is subject to continual re-assessment and sensitivity analysis. The cash\\nflow position is reviewed by the board and by each of the Company’s banking partners on a monthly basis.\\nThe Company has excellent relationships with the three banks currently funding the business and has sufficient\\nfacilities available to ensure the continuing operation of the business on all sites currently under construction.\\noperating review\\nannual report and accounts 2008     32\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:56  Page 33 Telford RA  24/6/08  17:56  Page 34 corporate responsibility\\nregeneration\\n“Through the development of top quality and well connected\\nhousing schemes Telford Homes is a significant contributor to the\\nregeneration of run-down housing estates and obsolete industrial\\nland to provide inclusive, balanced and sustainable communities.”\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:56  Page 35 “My goal for this year is\\nto achieve our Occupational\\nHealth and Safety Management\\nSystem (OHSAS) 18001\\naccreditation which will be a\\nsignificant step in demonstrating\\nour ongoing commitment to\\nhealth and safety.”\\nSteve Nicoll \\nGroup Health & Safety Manager\\nThe Company continues to regard the\\npromotion of health and safety as a critical\\nobjective of all employees at every level.\\nEvery employee is issued with health and\\nsafety instructions that endeavour to identify\\nall the risks and dangers that are likely to be\\nencountered in the course of their work and\\nset out precautionary measures. \\nAs the Company continues to grow,\\nrecruitment of key staff remains crucial in\\nsustaining the Company ethos regarding the\\nhigh health and safety standards expected\\nfrom our employees. \\nWe continue to invest in the training\\nand development of our people with the\\nintroduction of our ‘Health and Safety Core’\\ntraining programme.

These are the Company's first financial statements\\nprepared under IFRS and IFRS 1 has been applied. An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected\\nthe reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company is provided in note 21.\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires\\nthe use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of\\nthe financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\\nAlthough these estimates are based on the directors best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual\\nresults ultimately may differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates made by the directors in these\\nfinancial statements are set out in 'Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty'.\\nThe Company has a dormant subsidiary and has elected to apply the Companies Act 1985 exemption from\\npreparing consolidated financial statements on the basis that the subsidiary is immaterial. Instead, the\\nCompany has prepared economic interest financial statements in which the Company's share in jointly\\ncontrolled entities is proportionally consolidated.\\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently for all periods presented in these\\nfinancial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1st April 2006 for the purpose of\\nthe transition to IFRS.\\nAccounting convention\\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with\\napplicable International Accounting Standards.\\nJointly controlled entities\\nA jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Company holds an interest with one or more other\\nparties where a contractual arrangement has established joint control over the entity. Jointly controlled\\nentities are accounted for using proportional consolidation.\\nRevenue and profit recognition\\nRevenue is recognised from the date of exchange of contracts for the sale of properties at a rate\\nequivalent to the value of work undertaken in respect of land development. The value of revenue less\\ndeposits and completion monies received is included as amounts recoverable on contracts within trade\\nreceivables. All revenue is generated in the United Kingdom. \\nProfit on developments is recognised over the life of each development in proportion to revenue only to\\nthe extent that the total eventual profit on the development can be foreseen with reasonable certainty.\\nUntil there is reasonable certainty over the final outcome of a development the profit is restricted to the\\nnon-refundable deposits received. Losses are provided for as soon as foreseen.\\nCommission received on property sales made on behalf of third parties is recorded within revenue, with all\\ncosts associated with the sale of those properties recognised within cost of sales.\\nFinance leases and hire purchase contracts\\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks\\nand rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\\nAssets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are recognised as assets of the Company at their\\nfair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of\\nthe lease and depreciated over the shorter of their expected useful lives and the lease term. The corresponding\\nliability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease or hire purchase obligation. Lease payments are\\napportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligations so as to achieve a constant rate of\\ninterest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the income statement.\\n61     annual report and accounts 2008\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:57  Page 62 Operating leases\\nOperating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.\\nPension costs\\nContributions paid to group personal pension schemes (defined contribution), in respect of employees, are\\ncharged to the income statement as incurred.\\nProperty, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on\\na straight line basis at rates calculated to write down the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset\\nover its expected useful life as follows:\\nLeasehold improvements - shorter of term of lease and 10 years\\nPlant and machinery - 2 to 5 years\\nMotor vehicles - 3 years\\nInventories\\nDevelopment properties are included in inventories and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable\\nvalue. Cost comprises costs of acquisition and development, including directly attributable fees and\\nexpenses and direct labour costs but not loan interest. Included within development properties are\\nfreehold interests held in completed developments. These are held for future sale. \\nFinancial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company's balance sheet when the Company\\nbecomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument.\\nTrade receivables and other receivables\\nTrade receivables on normal terms do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value reduced\\nby appropriate allowances for estimated unrecoverable amounts.\\nCash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents are defined as cash balances in hand and in the bank (including short-term cash\\ndeposits) which mature within three months or less from the date of acquisition.\\nBorrowings\\nInterest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. Interest payable on\\nbank loans and overdrafts is written off to the income statement using the effective interest method. \\nTrade payables\\nTrade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.\\nLand creditors\\nWhen land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Company initially records it at its fair value with\\na land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment. Fair value is\\ndetermined by using the effective interest method. The difference between the nominal value and the\\ninitial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance costs,\\nincreasing the value of the land creditor so that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the\\npayment required.\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual\\narrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the\\nassets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are\\nrecorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\\nannual report and accounts 2008     62\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:57  Page 63 statement of accounting policies 31st March 2008\\nCurrent assets and liabilities\\nAssets that are expected to be realised in, or are intended for sale or consumption in the Company's\\nnormal operating cycle are treated as current even to the extent these are expected to be realised after\\ntwelve months from the balance sheet date. Liabilities that are expected to be settled in the Company's\\nnormal operating cycle are treated as current even though these may be due for settlement after twelve\\nmonths from the balance sheet date.\\nContingent liabilities\\nDisclosures are made for each class of contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date detailing, where\\npracticable, an estimate of their financial effect and an indication of uncertainties associated with the\\ntiming or amount of the outflow, unless the possibility of a financial outflow is remote.\\nTaxation\\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\\nThe tax currently payable is based on the profits for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported\\nin the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are tax deductible in other years\\nand it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is\\ncalculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.\\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at\\nthe balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the\\nfuture or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.\\nA net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all\\navailable evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits\\nfrom which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.\\nDeferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or\\ncredited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.\\nShare-based payments\\nIn accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of equity settled share options granted is recognised as an\\nemployee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured as at the date the\\noptions are granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model and is charged equally over the vesting\\nperiod. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted each reporting period to reflect the actual\\nnumber of options that are expected to vest.\\nWith respect to share-based payments, a deferred tax asset is recognised on the relevant tax base. \\nThe tax base is then compared to the cumulative share-based payment expense recognised in the income\\nstatement. Deferred tax arising on the excess of the tax base over the cumulative share-based payment\\nexpense recognised in the income statement has been recognised directly in equity.\\nOwn shares\\nShares held by employee benefit trusts in order to satisfy awards under the Company's share plans are\\nincluded net within equity until such time as the shares are vested to the relevant employees.\\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\\nRevenue and profit recognition\\nRevenue is recognised from the date of exchange of contracts for the sale of properties at a rate\\nequivalent to the value of work undertaken in respect of land development. Profit on developments is\\nrecognised in proportion to revenue only to the extent that the total eventual profit on the development\\ncan be foreseen with reasonable certainty.\\n63     annual report and accounts 2008\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:57  Page 64 annual report and accounts 2008     64\\nAssessing the percentage complete on each development involves estimation of total expected costs to be incurred\\nuntil the end of the development. Recognition of profit also involves estimation of the total expected revenue\\nfrom each development and therefore the expected profit margin that will be achieved. Judgement is required\\nto assess whether the total eventual profit on each development can be foreseen with reasonable certainty.\\nCarrying value of land and work in progress\\nInventories include land and work in progress in respect of development sites. In some cases land is held\\nawaiting a planning consent. On each development judgement is required to assess whether the cost of\\nland and any associated work in progress is in excess of its net realisable value.\\nRecent accounting developments\\nAt the date of the authorisation of these financial statements, there are a number of standards,\\namendments and interpretations that have been published. The Company has not early adopted any\\nstandards, amendments or interpretations.\\nThe standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to impact upon the Company are:\\nIAS 23 (Amendment) 'Borrowing costs'. The amendment to the standard requires an entity to capitalise\\nborrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset\\n(one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) as part of the cost of that asset.\\nThe option of immediately expensing borrowing costs is removed. The amendment will apply to the\\nCompany from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009.\\nIAS 1 (Amendment) 'Presentation of Financial Statements'. This amendment prohibits the presentation of items\\nof income and expense (that is 'non-owner changes in equity') in the statement of changes in equity. Revised\\nIAS 1 also sets out the additional disclosure requirements for entities making restatements or reclassifications.\\nThe amendment will apply to the Company from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009.\\nIFRS 2 (Amendment) 'Share-based payments'. This amendment clarifies that vesting conditions are service\\nand performance conditions only. It also specifies that all cancellations should receive the same accounting\\ntreatment, whether cancelled by the entity or by other parties. The amendment will apply to the\\nCompany from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009.\\nThe following standards, amendments and interpretations are not expected to have any material impact\\non the financial statements of the Company:\\nIFRS 3 (Amendment) 'Business combinations' applies to the Company from the annual period commencing\\n1st April 2010. This standard includes some significant changes to how the acquisition method is applied\\nto business combinations.\\nIFRS 8 'Operating segments' applies to the Company from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009.\\nIFRS 8 amends the current segmental reporting requirement of IAS 14 and requires 'management\\napproach' to be adopted so that segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for\\ninternal reporting purposes.  \\nIAS 27 (Amendment) 'Consolidated and separate financial statements' applies to the Company from the\\nannual period commencing 1st April 2010. The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions\\nwith non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control.\\nIAS 32 (Amendment) 'Financial Instruments: Presentation' and IAS 1 (Amendment) 'Presentation of\\nFinancial Statements - Puttable Instruments and Instruments with Obligations Arising on Liquidation'\\napplies to the Company from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009.\\nIFRIC 12 'Service concession arrangements' applies to the Company from the annual period commencing\\n1st April 2008.\\nIFRIC 13 'Customer loyalty programmes' applies to the Company from the annual period commencing\\n1st April 2008.\\nIFRIC 14 'The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction'\\napplies to the Company from the annual period commencing 1st April 2008.\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:57  Page 65 notes to the financial statements 31st March 2008\\n1 Operating profit Year ended Year ended\\n31st March 2008 31st March 2007\\n£000 £000\\nOperating profit is stated after charging (crediting):\\nDepreciation - owned assets 230 204\\n- hire purchase assets 128 156\\nOperating lease rentals - property 162 162\\n- motor vehicles 216 175\\n- plant and machinery - 3\\nProfit on sale of tangible assets (24) (34)\\nIn addition the following has been charged in respect of auditors’ remuneration:\\nAudit and related services (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP)\\nStatutory audit of the financial statements 59 57\\nOther services including non-audit services (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP)\\nThe audit of jointly controlled entity accounts pursuant to legislation 7 5\\nOther services provided pursuant to such legislation - -\\nOther services relating to taxation 23 13\\nAll other services 21 22\\nOther services including non-audit services (Moore Stephens LLP)\\nThe audit of jointly controlled entity accounts pursuant to legislation - 8\\nOther services provided pursuant to such legislation - 5\\nOther services relating to taxation - 14\\n65     annual report and accounts 2008\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:57  Page 66 annual report and accounts 2008     66\\n2 Employee benefit expense\\nThe average monthly number of persons employed by the Company, including executive directors, during\\nthe year analysed by activity was as follows:\\nYear ended Year ended\\n31st March 2008 31st March 2007\\nNumber Number\\nConstruction 88 67\\nAdministration 62 50\\n150 117\\nThe employment costs of all employees included above were:\\nYear ended Year ended\\n31st March 2008 31st March 2007\\n£000 £000\\nWages and salaries 8,045 6,278\\nSocial security costs 901 686\\nOther pension costs - group personal pension arrangements 324 252\\n9,270 7,216\\nThe Company operates a group personal pension scheme for its employees.

This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and\\nconfers certain tax advantages for participating employees.\\nThe SIP provides for employees to purchase shares up to a value of £1,500 in each tax year. These shares\\nare known as 'Partnership shares'. Partnership shares are matched on a one for one basis by 'Matching\\nshares' provided by the Company subject to the shares remaining in the SIP for a period not less than\\nthree years. Dividends are paid on both Partnership and Matching shares and these are allocated to\\nemployees as 'Dividend shares'.\\nThe Company has set up a trust to administer the SIP and to hold shares on behalf of individual\\nemployees. This trust is an entirely separate entity to the Company and is managed by a corporate trustee,\\nTelford Homes Trustees Limited. The costs associated with the trust are paid for by the Company and the\\nCompany finances all share purchases.\\nThe trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating in the\\nscheme. These shares remain in the trust until such time as an employee withdraws from the SIP . Further shares\\nhave been allocated to employees as Matching shares and the cost of these shares is being written off over the\\nthree year holding period.

An employee benefit trust (the Telford Homes Plc\\n2006 Employee Benefit Trust) was set up with Abacus Corporate Trustee Limited acting as trustee.\\nParticipants in the DPSPP are offered a loan by the trustee to enable them to subscribe for a specified\\nnumber of shares in the Company at market value. This loan is interest free and repayable on or before\\nthe repayment date which is normally ten years from the date of the loan or on leaving employment or\\ndisposing of the shares. The loan has limited recourse such that repayment is limited to the value of the\\nshares on the repayment date. The Company will lend the trustee sufficient funds to enable the trustee to\\nprovide the loans to individual participants. All shares acquired under the DPSPP will be subject to a three\\nyear vesting period and are held by the trustee for the benefit of the participants. Offers to participants\\nwill be made periodically at the discretion of the directors of Telford Homes Plc.\\nIn September 2006 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 550,000 shares at the\\nmarket value of 260p. These shares were issued on 9th November 2006. On this date the Company\\nprovided a loan to the trustee of £1,430,000 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the\\nparticipants.

Volatility of interest\\ncosts remained at an acceptable level in the year ended 31st March 2008. Interest on all facilities currently\\nheld is charged at floating interest rates and the Company assesses the requirement for fixing interest\\nrates on a regular basis.\\nThe effect on the income statement of a 1% rise and a 1% fall in interest rates has been calculated to\\nassess interest rate sensitivity. Based on average monthly borrowings in the year, a 1% rise in interest rates\\nwould have a negative effect of £988,000 before tax (2007 - £558,000), a 1% fall in interest rates gives the\\nsame but opposite effect.\\nCredit risk\\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.\\nTrade and other receivables include amounts recoverable on contracts from individual purchasers where\\ntitle to each property does not pass until the outstanding balance of the purchase price has been paid.\\nDeposits already received can be retained by the Company. The Company therefore considers that\\nadequate security is held against each individual balance.\\nTrade and other receivables also include amounts receivable from housing associations and jointly\\ncontrolled entities and the Company considers the credit quality of the various debtors to be good in\\nrespect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low.\\nSurplus cash is held in secure bank deposit accounts with banks that have high credit ratings as set by\\ninternational credit rating agencies.\\nLiquidity risk\\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its\\nobligations as they fall due.\\nThe Company manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows over a five\\nyear period and performing sensitivity analysis on these forecasts. The Company utilises bank loan facilities\\nto ensure that adequate funding is available to cover working capital requirements.\\nThe Company considers that current unutilised facilities are sufficient to cover funding requirements in the\\nforeseeable future.\\nannual report and accounts 2008     82\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:57  Page 83 notes to the financial statements 31st March 2008\\n20 Financial instruments (continued)\\nThe maturity profile of financial liabilities is as follows:\\nTrade Land Borrowings Net hire Total\\npayables creditors purchase\\nliabilities\\n£000 £000 £000 £000 £000\\nWithin one year 8,126 13,696 38,042 83 59,947\\nMore than one year and - - 49,816 18 49,834\\nless than two years\\nMore than two years and - - 13,566 - 13,566\\nless than five years\\n31st March 2008 8,126 13,696 101,424 101 123,347\\nTrade Land Borrowings Net hire Total\\npayables creditors purchase\\nliabilities\\n£000 £000 £000 £000 £000\\nWithin one year 5,555 1,422 20,302 113 27,392\\nMore than one year and - - 42,264 78 42,342\\nless than two years\\nMore than two years and - - 10,644 18 10,662\\nless than five years\\n31st March 2007 5,555 1,422 73,210 209 80,396\\n83     annual report and accounts 2008\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:57  Page 84 21 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)\\nAs stated in the statement of accounting policies, these are the Company's first financial statements\\nprepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. \\nThe accounting policies set out in the statement of accounting policies have been applied in preparing the\\nfinancial statements for the year ended 31st March 2008, the comparative information presented in these\\nfinancial statements for the year ended 31st March 2007 and in the preparation of the opening IFRS\\nbalance sheet at 1st April 2006 (the date of transition). In preparing the IFRS opening balance sheet, the\\nCompany has restated the figures previously reported in accordance with UK GAAP.\\nAn explanation of each IFRS that has resulted in a restatement of the figures prepared under UK GAAP is\\ngiven below. This is followed by reconciliations between UK GAAP and IFRS covering the income\\nstatement and balance sheet for the year ended 31st March 2007 and the balance sheet at 31st March\\n2006. There is no impact on the Company's cash flows. \\nIAS 12 Income taxes\\nIAS 12 requires that the expected value of future tax deductions relating to the exercise of share options\\nis recognised as a deferred tax asset over the vesting period of the options. Under UK GAAP deferred tax\\nwas recognised only to the extent that a charge for share-based payments was recorded in the profit and\\nloss account. Under IAS 12 any deferred tax over and above that on the share-based payment charge is\\nrecognised directly in equity. Under IAS 12 other charges and tax credits in respect of employee share\\nschemes are taken directly to equity rather than adjusting the tax charge in the year.\\nAdoption of IAS 12 results in an additional deferred tax asset of £324,000 at 31st March 2006 and £297,000\\nat 31st March 2007. The movement in this additional asset is recognised partly through the income\\nstatement and partly directly in equity depending on the calculation of share-based payment charges.\\nThe tax charge in the income statement for the year ended 31st March 2007 has increased by £308,000 as \\na result of net tax credits recognised in respect of employee share schemes being taken directly to equity. \\nIAS 39 Financial instruments - recognition and measurement\\nIAS 39 requires that financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at their fair value. For land\\npurchased on extended payment terms the Company will initially record it at its fair value with a land\\ncreditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment. Previously land\\npurchased on extended payment terms was recognised at the cost determined in the purchase contract.\\nThe difference between the ultimate cost of the land and the initial fair value will be amortised over the\\nperiod of the extended payment term and charged to finance costs increasing the value of the land\\ncreditor such that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the payment required.      \\nUnder UK GAAP the balance sheet at 31st March 2007 included a liability of £1.4 million in relation to\\nland purchased at Queen Mary's Gate, South Woodford on extended payment terms. Adjusting this to\\nfair value has reduced the liability by £73,000 and reduced inventories by the same amount. The interest\\ncharge in the year to 31st March 2007 has increased by £5,000 as a result of amortising the difference\\nbetween the ultimate cost of the land and the fair value over the period of the extended payment term.\\nIn addition the recognition of profit at the development has changed to reflect the reduction in the\\nrecognised cost of the land resulting in a reduction in revenue of £24,000 and a reduction in trade\\nreceivables of the same amount and a reduction in cost of sales of £39,000 and a reduction in inventories\\nof the same amount. No restatement was required to the opening balance sheet at 1st April 2006.\\nannual report and accounts 2008     84\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:57  Page 85 notes to the financial statements 31st March 2008\\n85     annual report and accounts 2008\\n21 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (continued)\\nIFRS income statement reconciliation for the year ended 31st March 2007\\nPreviously IAS 12 IAS 39 Effect of Restated \\nreported Income Financial transition under \\nunder UK GAAP taxes instruments to IFRS IFRS\\n£000 £000 £000 £000 £000\\nRevenue 104,407 -

This\\nhas been accelerated by the £14.4\\nmillion net funds raised in a placing at\\nthe end of 2006.  Mike North has joined\\nour land team alongside Jim Furlong\\nand Nick Drew our Partnerships Director\\nand Mike has already been responsible\\nfor some significant site acquisitions.\\nSome of the land acquired benefited\\nfrom detailed planning permission such\\nthat development could commence\\nalmost immediately. SoBow, E3 was\\npurchased from one of our affordable\\nhousing partners with the benefit of a\\nresolution to grant planning permission\\nfor 201 homes. Development is now\\nunderway and will be completed in\\n2009. We have recently purchased a\\nsite at Leyton Orient Football Club\\nwhere redevelopment adjacent to the\\nNorth and South stands incorporates\\na planning permission for 62 homes.\\nA number of land acquisitions were\\nsubject to receipt of satisfactory\\nplanning permission. These include land\\nwithin the British Estate, E3 which\\nreceived a resolution to grant planning\\npermission to provide 161 new private\\nhomes in January 2007. Since the share\\nplacing we have also contracted to\\npurchase a major site in Greenwich in a\\njoint venture with The Royal Bank of\\nScotland. The contract is subject to\\nreceipt of planning permission for 372\\nhomes which is expected in the next few\\nmonths. This will be our second joint\\nventure with The Royal Bank of\\nScotland and our success together at\\nIcona, Stratford has led us to continue\\nour partnership on this exciting scheme. \\nWe have also added to our medium to\\nlonger term development pipeline with\\nthe acquisition of sites that we will\\nprogress through the planning process.\\nThe former Lesney Toys factory in\\nHomerton Road, Hackney is expected to\\nachieve planning permission for over\\n200 homes and commercial space,\\nincluding affordable art studios. In\\naddition the Hannaford and Marshall site\\nin Bethnal Green Road near Liverpool\\nStreet station has been acquired in a\\njoint venture with Genesis Housing\\nGroup and is expected to achieve\\nplanning permission for more than 300\\nhomes and commercial space.\\n(Left to right) Neil Brooks Partnerships Manager, Mike North Senior Land Buyer, Nick Drew Partnerships Director\\nAnnual report and accounts 07 10\\nR&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:27  Page 11 Chief Executive’s review\\n11 Annual report and accounts 07\\nCGI of Queen Mary’s Gate\\nQueen Mary’s Gate Sales Centre, South Woodford\\nR&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:27  Page 12 Business and financial review\\nPlanning\\nThe planning process is more\\ncomplicated than ever before with an\\nincreasing number of external\\nconsultants’ reports being required\\nfor each application. A key\\ncompetitive advantage comes from\\nknowing your way through the\\nprocess and our knowledge of the\\nlocal planning environment in East\\nLondon puts us in a strong position,\\nwhile not removing all of the hurdles\\nthat can be placed in our path. \\nDevelopment pipeline\\nOur development pipeline, being\\nproperties that will produce profit in\\nfuture years not including those built for\\njoint venture partners, consists of 1,279\\nproperties with planning permission and\\n942 subject to the planning process.\\nThis is a total of 2,221 properties which\\nare expected to provide turnover in\\nexcess of £500 million and gross profit\\nof over £100 million, more than four\\nyears supply at current levels of profit.\\nOf this forecast gross profit in the\\npipeline over £24 million has been\\nsecured by contracts already exchanged\\nand this will be recognised as\\nconstruction proceeds on developments\\nover the next two to three years. Gross\\nprofit in the year ended 31st March 2007\\nwas £23.4 million.\\nOur partnership with Eastend Homes\\nhas added the homes on the British\\nEstate to our pipeline. During the year\\nwe have been chosen as the\\ndevelopment partner to Eastend\\nHomes on a number of other well\\nlocated estates in Tower Hamlets. We\\nhave secured this partnership due to\\nthe quality of the Telford Homes brand\\nwhich incorporates a straight-forward\\nand honest approach. We are now\\nprogressing master plans for the\\nregeneration of these estates and we\\nexpect to achieve planning permissions\\nand then commence construction on\\nall of them over the next two years. The\\nBritish Estate has set the model for this\\npartnership with land payments made\\nby Telford Homes being reinvested into\\nthe third party refurbishment of existing\\nhomes on the estate.\\nPeople\\nSeveral senior members of staff have\\nbeen recruited as we continue to plan\\nfor the future and ensure that our\\ninternal infrastructure is always one\\nstep ahead of our growth plans.\\nWe finished the year with over 120\\nemployees and our strength in every\\narea is evident from our performance\\nover the last 12 months. I would like to\\nthank each and every one of our\\nemployees for their efforts this year.\\nStrategy\\nEach year the directors review the\\nstrategy of Telford Homes to ensure\\nthat we are creating maximum value for\\nshareholders and taking advantage of\\nall the opportunities that come our way\\nwhile minimising risks in the business.\\nThere are so many opportunities in\\nEast London, and our knowledge of this\\nmarket place is so strong, that we will\\nlargely remain focused on this region.\\nWe expect to continue to pre-sell a\\nproportion of our developments,\\ndepending on their location, in order to\\nsecure future cash flows and minimise\\nthe funding risks. \\nIn doing this we will maintain organic\\ngrowth at a controlled rate in order to\\ncapitalise on the imbalance between\\nsupply and demand for properties in\\nour area of operation. This was part of\\nthe reasoning for the share placing last\\nyear and will be our main driver in the\\nfuture while the market remains stable.\\nInterest rates will be a key factor in the\\nstability or otherwise of the market and\\nthe mechanics of supply and demand\\nwill also play a significant role in the\\ncoming years.\\nCurrent trading and outlook\\nOur recent sales launches are an\\nindication that the market in East\\nLondon remains strong despite rising\\ninterest rates. We were extremely\\npleased with the results of these sales\\nevents and the upcoming launch of\\nMerchants’ Quarter, the marketing\\nname for the British Estate, has\\nreceived a high level of interest.\\nTo date, due to contracts exchanged\\nsince 31st March 2007 and properties\\nsold, subject to contract, we have a\\ntotal of 185 private homes and 25\\naffordable homes contributing to our\\nresults for 2008. The demand for\\nhomes in East London, the strength of\\nour development pipeline and our\\nongoing partnerships with affordable\\nhousing providers lead me to expect\\n2008 to be another year of record\\nresults and another step forward in the\\ndevelopment of Telford Homes.\\nAndrew Wiseman\\nChief Executive\\n21st May 2007\\nProperties in the development pipeline\\n2,221\\nAnnual report and accounts 07 12\\nTurnover in the development pipeline\\n£500million\\nR&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:27  Page 13 Financial review\\n“Another year of record turnover\\nand profits has been underpinned\\nby increasing the capital available\\nto the Company through a share\\nplacing and managing those funds\\nto maximise return on equity while\\nadding a balanced portfolio of\\nsites to our development pipeline.”\\nJonathan Di-Stefano \\nFinancial Director\\nOperating results\\nTurnover increased to £104.4 million\\nfrom £79.3 million last year. An analysis\\nof properties sold in the year is given in\\nthe Chief Executive’s review.\\nGross profit has increased to £23.4\\nmillion with the margin falling to 22.4%\\nfrom 23.0% last year. Each new site is\\nappraised to achieve a gross margin\\nof at least 20% unless high returns on\\nequity can be secured in exchange for\\nlower margins. Queen Mary’s Gate in\\nSouth Woodford was purchased for\\nconsideration of 35% of all private\\nsales proceeds achieved from the\\ndevelopment. The total expected\\npayments are now in excess of £35\\nmillion with only £10 million paid to\\ndate, resulting in a high rate of return\\non equity. The profit margin on our\\nshare of sales proceeds is in excess of\\n20% as this represents our risk in the\\ndevelopment. However the reported\\nmargin is 13% when taking the proceeds\\nbeing paid directly to the vendor into\\naccount, still in line with our original\\nexpectations for the site. The gross\\nmargin in 2007 excluding Queen Mary’s\\nGate is 23.5% and this development will\\ncontinue to depress the reported\\nmargin over the next few years.\\nOur forecasting and control of\\ndevelopment costs has been excellent\\nover the last 12 months with fewer\\nmovements being reported in monthly\\ncost control meetings. Build costs in\\nthe year were £50 million and the\\noperational teams are clearly well set\\nto manage this level of expenditure. \\nThe operating margin has fallen to\\n16.0% from 16.2% with overheads\\nreducing as a percentage of turnover\\nto 6.4% from 6.8% last year.\\nOverheads have remained under\\ncareful control while also allowing us\\nto put the appropriate infrastructure\\nin place prior to each growth phase\\nand ensuring our employees are\\nrewarded for their contribution to the\\nsuccess of the Company.  \\nInterest\\nInterest paid in the year was £4.0\\nmillion up from £3.1 million last year.\\nThis was mainly due to the increase in\\nactivity during the year along with\\nrising interest rates.\\nInterest received in the year was £0.8\\nmillion up from £0.2 million last year as a\\nresult of higher cash balances during the\\nyear, particularly after the share placing.\\nGross margin\\n22.4%\\n13 Annual report and accounts 07\\nR&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:27  Page 14 Business and financial review\\nAnnual report and accounts 07 14\\nCarr Street, E14\\nR&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:27  Page 15 Estilo, N1\\nFinancial review\\n15 Annual report and accounts 07\\nThe continuing increases in the base\\nrate are a cause for concern for the\\nbusiness as a whole although any\\nnegative effects are yet to materialise.\\nIn terms of finance costs we monitor\\nthis carefully and forecast future rate\\nrises on a prudent basis. Interest cover\\nwas 5.2 times in 2007 which remains\\nwell within acceptable limits.\\nProfit before tax has increased to £13.5\\nmillion from £10.0 million last year. \\nTaxation\\nThe effective tax charge for the year is\\n26.3% down from 29.7% last year. This\\nchange is due to a prior year over\\nprovision of £178,000 and a significant\\ntax deduction this year in relation to\\nthe exercise of share options which\\nreduces the tax charge by £309,000. \\nDividends\\nA final dividend of 4.9p per ordinary\\nshare has been proposed. Together with\\nthe interim dividend of 4.0p paid in\\nJanuary 2007 this makes a total\\ndividend for the year of 8.9p which is\\ncovered 3.4 times by earnings per share.\\nThe total dividend last year was 7.0p.\\nThe final dividend is expected to be\\npaid on 13th July 2007 to shareholders\\non the register on 22nd June 2007.\\nEarnings per share\\nEarnings per share increased to 30.3p\\nfrom 23.8p and the weighted average\\nnumber of shares in issue was 32.8\\nmillion. The 5.8 million shares issued as\\na result of the share placing diluted\\nearnings for five months. The funds\\nraised will make a more significant\\ncontribution to profits in 2008 and to\\na greater extent in 2009 and 2010.\\nBalance sheet\\nNet assets have increased to £54.5\\nmillion from £32.2 million with part of the\\nchange due to the £14.4 million raised in\\nthe share placing last year. The number\\nof shares in issue is now almost 37\\nmillion. Net assets per share at 31st\\nMarch were 148p up from 108p last year. \\nThe placing funds have all been\\nallocated to new land opportunities\\nwithin six months of the money being\\nreceived and while cash held at the\\nend of March was £17.6 million, the\\nmajority of this balance will be utilised\\nby future construction and the\\npurchase of new development sites\\nthat are already under contract.

Gearing at\\n31st March 2007 was 102% reduced\\nfrom 193% last year. This reduction is a\\ndirect result of the cash balances held at\\nthe end of the year. We are comfortable\\nwith higher levels of gearing as we\\ncontinue to monitor the certainty of\\nfuture cash inflows against exposure to\\ndebt. Our business model of selling\\nproperties at an early stage of\\nconstruction reduces the risk of carrying\\ndebt as the sales revenue on a given\\ndevelopment, secured by exchanging\\ncontracts, will be used to repay loans\\nspecific to that development.\\nInternally we calculate ‘uncovered\\ngearing’ which excludes debt matched\\nby the value of contracts exchanged on\\na given development. This is becoming\\nan increasingly important performance\\nindicator in the business, particularly in\\nreporting to banks. The board has\\ndetermined that levels of uncovered\\ngearing are acceptable up to 100%.\\nUncovered gearing at 31st March 2007\\nwas 18% reduced from 60% last year.\\nCash flow\\nWe maintain a detailed cash flow\\nforecast as part of our management\\ninformation systems.

This appointment will help to\\nensure that health and safety remains the first concern of the Company as the business develops. \\nOur Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) is at an all time low and below the industry average. The number of man-hours worked on site\\nin a given 12 month period has continued to grow and is now over 1 million hours per year.  The increase in activity is being\\neffectively managed by our construction teams without putting health and safety at risk. \\nWe continue to identify new ways of working to reduce wasteful practices and processes. One example of this is the ‘bathroom\\npods’ being installed on a number of our developments. These inherently labour intensive rooms are manufactured off site,\\nbefore being delivered and installed, following the principles set out in the Construction Design and Management Regulations\\n2007 by designing out risk wherever possible.  \\nThis year we have formed an ‘Executive Safety Committee’ and an ‘Operational Safety Forum’ as part of the overall strategy for\\nmanaging change as the business grows and develops. It has been recognised that our approach to health and safety will be developed\\nthrough these groups by encouraging an inclusive culture throughout the business and delivering integrated solutions.    \\nMark Parker and John Fitzgerald continue to be responsible for health and safety in each of the operating divisions with the assistance of\\nSteve Nicoll. David Durant, Group Managing Director, is the board member with overall responsibility for health and safety.\\n“One of the main reasons for joining Telford Homes was the passion I witnessed in everyone I met. A few months on I have not\\nseen anybody within the Company that does not share in the aspirations of the business. This is reinforced on site by the\\ncommitment and integrity of the site teams in undertaking their duties in a professional manner. My main goal is to further\\ndevelop and monitor policies and procedures in the light of the continuing growth of the Company. I am looking forward to the\\nchallenges and feel privileged to be part of the Telford Homes team.”\\nSteve Nicoll\\n27 Annual report and accounts 07\\n“It is the policy of Telford Homes Plc\\nthat our operations are conducted\\nin such a way as to safeguard the\\nhealth, safety and welfare of all our\\npeople and all other persons who\\nmay be affected by our activities.”\\nSteve Nicoll \\nGroup Health and Safety Manager\\nR&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:28  Page 28 Corporate responsibility \\nOneStratford under construction\\nAnnual report and accounts 07 28\\nR&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:28  Page 29 Environment and Sustainability\\nThe key aims of the policy are:\\n• Integration of environmental responsibilities into the organisation.\\n• Ensuring that all operations take account of the Environmental Protection Act.\\n• Undertaking regular reviews of our working practices to minimise pollution and waste.\\n• Ensuring that contractors involved in the removal of waste are registered carriers.\\n• Assessment of any environmental impact when performing risk assessments for the control of substances hazardous to health.\\n• A commitment to achieving high levels of energy efficiency and water management in all of our operations.\\nThere are many examples of this policy in action in our business:\\n• On almost all of our sites we undertake extensive remediation works in existing residential areas to remove pollutants and\\nmaterial harmful to the environment.\\n• Recycling of waste is undertaken wherever possible including the use of crush concrete from demolished buildings for ground\\nworks on the same developments and the recycling of plasterboard and other materials. \\n• In our internal specification we provide low energy light fittings, dual-flush toilets, aerators on taps and flow restrictors on\\nshowers to save water.\\n• Recent schemes have aimed for 10% of all energy to come from a sustainable source which can include the use of biomass\\nboilers for central heating and hot water and these are fuelled by wood pellets from managed forests.\\n• Timber from sustainable sources is now used exclusively on all developments.\\n• We are exploring the possibility of a timber panel solution for one of our developments which will have a much lower carbon\\nfootprint than traditional methods of construction.\\n• Methods of harnessing natural energy such as solar panels and ground source heat pumps are being incorporated into a\\nnumber of developments.\\n• The external structures of our buildings are designed with enhanced thermal properties to reduce their carbon footprint,\\nincluding high-performance glazing systems and where appropriate mechanical ventilation systems, incorporating heat\\nrecovery systems to complement natural air circulation. \\n• We use tyre rubber as a sound deadening membrane in a number of our developments thereby recycling waste materials and\\nreducing noise pollution.\\n• We have designed underground refuse facilities at recent sites which are self contained and environmentally friendly and on\\nlarger developments we are introducing recycling facilities alongside the normal refuse bins.\\n• We are increasing our use of pre-fabricated external walls and bathroom pods and these reduce waste as they are\\nmanufactured off-site.\\n• Many of our developments are ‘car free’ and these are usually located near public transport links and have provision for\\nbicycles to be stored.\\n• Ecological reports have helped us to assess the ways in which existing species can be nurtured once a development is complete. Bat\\nboxes and brown roofs have been positive additions to recent developments to enhance the built environment for urban wildlife.\\n29 Annual report and accounts 07\\nTelford Homes is committed to supporting the\\nenvironment and minimising any harmful impact\\nour business activities have upon it.

They have all been applied consistently throughout the year\\nand the preceding year except as noted below.\\nChanges in accounting policy\\nThe Company has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 20 'Share-based payment' for the year ended 31st March\\n2007. As a result of this, a charge is made to the profit and loss account to reflect the calculated fair value of\\nemployee share options over and above the exercise price paid by employees (note 18). This charge is calculated at\\nthe date of grant of the options and is charged equally over the vesting period. The corresponding adjustment to\\nreserves is made directly to the profit and loss reserve.  \\nAccounting convention\\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable\\nUK accounting standards.\\nTurnover and profit recognition\\nTurnover is recognised from the date of exchange of contracts for the sale of properties at a rate equivalent to the\\nvalue of work undertaken in respect of land development. The value of turnover less deposits and completion monies\\nreceived is included as amounts recoverable on contracts within debtors. All turnover is generated in the United\\nKingdom. Commission received on property sales made on behalf of third parties is recorded within turnover, with all\\ncosts associated with the sale of those properties recognised within cost of sales.\\nProfit on developments is recognised over the life of each development in proportion to turnover only to the extent\\nthat the total eventual profit on the development can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Until there is reasonable\\ncertainty over the final outcome of a development the profit is restricted to the non-refundable deposits received.\\nLosses are provided for as soon as foreseen.\\nJoint arrangements\\nThe Company has certain contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do not\\ncreate an entity carrying on a trade or business of its own. The Company includes its share of the assets, liabilities,\\nprofits and cash flows in such joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of the arrangement and\\npro-rata to the Company's interest in the arrangement, in its financial statements. \\nDevelopment properties\\nDevelopment properties are included in stocks and work in progress and are stated at the lower of cost and net\\nrealisable value. Cost comprises costs of acquisition and development, including directly attributable fees and\\nexpenses but not loan interest. Included within development properties are freehold interests held in completed\\ndevelopments. These are recognised at a multiple of annual rental income.\\nTangible fixed assets and depreciation\\nTangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight line\\nbasis at rates calculated to write down the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected useful\\nlife as follows:\\nLeasehold improvements - shorter of term of lease and 10 years\\nPlant and machinery - 2 to 5 years\\nMotor vehicles - 3 years\\nFinancial statements section Financial statements\\nStatement of accounting policies 31st March 2007\\nAnnual report and accounts 07 50\\nR&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:29  Page 51 Statement of accounting policies 31st March 2007\\nTaxation\\nCorporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been\\nenacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.\\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance\\nsheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less\\ntax in the future have occurred. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the\\nperiods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted\\nor substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.\\nA net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised when, on the basis of all available\\nevidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the reversal\\nof the underlying timing differences can be deducted.\\nFinance leases and hire purchase contracts\\nAssets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and depreciated over the shorter of\\ntheir expected useful lives and the lease term. The capital elements of the future lease obligations are recorded as\\nliabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to\\nproduce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.\\nOperating leases\\nOperating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.\\nPension costs\\nContributions paid to group personal pension schemes (defined contribution), in respect of employees, are charged\\nto the profit and loss account as incurred.\\n51 Annual report and accounts 07\\nR&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:29  Page 52 Notes to the financial statements 31st March 2007\\n1  Operating profit Year ended Year ended\\n31st March 2007 31st March 2006\\n£000 £000\\nOperating profit is stated after charging (crediting):\\nDepreciation - owned assets 204 163\\n- hire purchase assets 156 149\\nOperating lease rentals   - property 162 149\\n- motor vehicles 175 156\\n- plant and machinery 3 3\\nProfit on sale of tangible fixed assets (34) (37)\\nIn addition the following has been charged in respect of auditors’ remuneration:\\nAudit and related services (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP)\\nStatutory audit of the financial statements 57 -\\nOther services including non-audit services (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP)\\nThe audit of subsidiary and joint arrangement accounts pursuant to legislation 5 -\\nOther services provided pursuant to such legislation - -\\nOther services relating to taxation 13 -\\nAll other services 22 -\\nAudit and related services (Moore Stephens LLP)\\nStatutory audit of the financial statements - 30\\nOther services including non-audit services (Moore Stephens LLP)\\nThe audit of subsidiary and joint arrangement accounts pursuant to legislation 8 3\\nOther services provided pursuant to such legislation 5 5\\nOther services relating to taxation 14 16\\nAll other services - -\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were appointed as the Company's auditors during the year.\\nFinancial statements\\nAnnual report and accounts 07 52\\nR&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:29  Page 53 Notes to the financial statements 31st March 2007\\n2  Directors' remuneration\\nThe total remuneration payable to the directors in the year was £1,033,304 (2006 - £874,799).\\nThe remuneration payable to the highest paid director was £208,068 (2006 - £176,056).

Dividends are paid on both\\nPartnership and Matching shares and these are allocated to employees as 'Dividend shares'.\\nThe Company has set up a trust to administer the SIP and to hold shares on behalf of individual employees. This trust is\\nan entirely separate entity to the Company and is managed by a corporate trustee, Telford Homes Trustees Limited.\\nThe costs associated with the trust are paid for by the Company and the Company finances all share purchases.\\nThe trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating in the scheme.\\nThese shares remain in the trust until such time as an employee withdraws from the SIP. Further shares have been\\nallocated to employees as Matching shares and the cost of these shares is being written off over the three year\\nholding period.

An employee benefit trust (the Telford Homes Plc 2006 Employee\\nBenefit Trust) was set up with Abacus Corporate Trustee Limited acting as trustee.\\nParticipants in the DPSPP are offered a loan by the trustee to enable them to subscribe for a specified number of\\nshares in the Company at market value. This loan is interest free, repayable on or before the repayment date, which is\\nnormally ten years from the date of the loan or on leaving employment or disposing of the shares. The loan has a\\nlimited recourse such that repayment is limited to the value of the shares on the repayment date. The Company will\\nlend the trustee sufficient funds to enable the trustee to provide the loans to individual participants. All shares acquired\\nunder the DPSPP will be subject to a three year vesting period and are held by the trustee for the benefit of the\\nparticipants. Offers to participants will be made periodically at the discretion of the directors of Telford Homes Plc.\\nIn September 2006 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 550,000 shares at the market\\nvalue of 260p.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 5\\nOUR SERVICES \\nTrading as the Utility Warehouse, Telecom Plus PLC provides a range of \\nessential services to households and small to medium-sized businesses, \\ngiving customers the convenience of a single monthly bill, great value, \\nand award-winning customer service. All customers become members of \\nour Discount Club (‘Members’), giving them access to a wide range of \\nadditional benefits.\\nThe Company avoids the need for expensive national advertising by \\nworking in partnership with over 44,000 part-time independent distributors \\n(‘Partners’), who sign-up new customers by telling them about the \\nadvantages of joining the Club. \\nIn general, the more services a Member takes from us, the better value \\nthey receive, with our lowest prices available to those who have chosen \\nour ‘Double Gold’ bundle (which includes all their energy and telephony \\nservices). Members can also benefit from using our exclusive CashBack \\ncard and online shopping tools.\\nPartners receive a small share of the revenues we receive from each new \\nMember they introduce, which encourages them to focus on finding \\ncreditworthy customers who take multiple services from us. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 6\\nCHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT \\nI am delighted to report another successful year for the Company \\nin which we have laid solid foundations for the next phase of our \\ndevelopment, whilst continuing to deliver strong levels of organic growth \\nacross all the core services we provide.\\nIn particular, the negotiation of a new energy supply agreement with \\nNpower during the autumn, which secures our access to the wholesale \\nenergy markets on improved commercial terms for a guaranteed period \\nof 20 years, has already enabled us to improve the competitiveness of our \\nretail energy tariffs compared with those offered by the ‘Big 6’ suppliers.\\nThe ongoing improvement in the quality of our customer base,  \\ncombined with the growth in the number of services we are providing, \\nmean that revenue and profitability for the year have again both  \\nreached record levels.\\nRESULTS OVERVIEW\\nAdjusted pre-tax profits increased by over 25% to £44.6m (2013: £35.6m) on revenue up by 9.5% to \\n£658.8m (2013: £601.5m); adjusted earnings per share for the year rose by 26.8% to 50.6p (2013: \\n39.9p).\\nThe relatively modest rise in revenue is due to continued strong organic growth in the number of customers \\nusing our services and industry wide increases in energy and telephony prices last autumn, partially offset \\nby much lower average energy consumption by domestic households during an exceptionally mild winter.\\nAdjusted pre-tax profits and earnings per share grew at a substantially faster rate than revenue, reflecting \\nthe steadily increasing size of our customer base (which was on average 18% higher than during the \\npreceding year), and an initial contribution from the new energy supply arrangements with Npower.\\nWe remain encouraged by the strong growth in the number of services we are providing, which reached \\n1,907,160 (2013: 1,602,060) by the year end – a record increase of over 305,000 services during the \\nyear and almost 40% higher than the growth achieved during the previous year. One of the highlights \\nwithin this strong performance has been a doubling in the proportion of new Members taking all five \\nof our core services (Gas, Electricity, Home Phone, Mobile and Broadband) since the introduction of \\nour new bundled service structure in November 2013. The average number of services taken by each \\nresidential Club Member has increased to 3.64 (2013: 3.54); these figures have been adjusted to reflect \\nthe auto-enrolment into the Club for the first time of around 60,000 residential customers (generally those \\nwho had moved into a property where we were already the incumbent energy supplier, and who have \\nnever consciously bought into our core multi-utility brand proposition), following our decision to abolish \\nmembership fees for all residential customers in the autumn. \\n‘‘\\n” Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\n \\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 7\\nIn line with previous guidance, we are proposing a final dividend of 19p (2013: 18p), bringing the total \\nfor the year to 35p (2013: 31p); this represents an increase of almost 13% compared with last year, but \\non a significantly larger number of shares in issue following the equity fundraising in December 2013. We \\nremain committed to a progressive dividend policy, although the rate of increase will be tempered over the \\nnext few years as we service and repay the £100m of debt we borrowed in the autumn to part-fund the \\ntransaction with Npower.\\nWe were delighted to receive a number of further endorsements from Which? during the year recognising \\nboth the value we offer and the quality of service provided by our UK based customer service team, \\nincluding being ranked first in their most recent survey of Fixed Telephony and Broadband suppliers, and \\nbeing nominated in two categories at their 2014 Annual Awards. This is a reflection of the continuing \\nfocus and significant ongoing resources invested into delivering the best possible service to our Members, \\nconsistent with securing our position as the Nation’s most trusted utility supplier. \\nOur share of the profits from Opus Energy Group Limited (“Opus”), in which we maintain a 20% stake, \\nincreased during the year to £4.7m (2013: £3.4m). This is an excellent result and reflects the continuing \\nstrong trading performance of the business.\\nNEW ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS \\nIn December 2013 we completed a transformational deal with Npower, which secured our supply of \\nwholesale energy for 20 years on improved commercial terms. This transaction involved us purchasing two \\nof their subsidiaries, Gas Plus Supply Limited and Electricity Plus Supply Limited, for a total consideration \\nof £218m (of which £21.5m is deferred for three years). The initial consideration was funded by a heavily \\noversubscribed equity fundraising which raised £130m before expenses, and new debt facilities provided \\nby Barclays Bank.\\nBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT\\nWe restructured the way we present and sell our services during the autumn by introducing an attractive \\nrange of ‘Gold’ bundles (with enhanced benefits and lower pricing available for Members choosing to \\ntake all their utilities from us), making our unique multi-utility sales proposition simpler for new Members to \\nunderstand and easier for our Partners to promote.\\nAt the same time we reduced the number of energy tariffs we offer to comply with our new licence \\nobligations, following Ofgem’s Retail Market Review, whilst taking advantage of the improved commercial \\nterms of our new energy supply arrangements to make our retail prices even more competitive.\\nIn March 2014, we launched a number of new tools designed to help our Partners promote our services \\nand build their businesses more effectively. These included a new film (featuring Sir Terry Wogan) to help \\nthem explain our unique Discount Club and the benefits we offer to potential new Members, a simplified \\nnew online application process, an animated video to explain our part-time income opportunity, a new \\n‘App’ which provides access in one place to all the main resources needed by our Partners, and an interest-\\nfree hire purchase scheme to enable them to acquire a suitable Tablet to take best advantage of these new \\ntools. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 8\\nWe have continued to invest in providing customer service that is genuinely best in class; improving the \\nclarity and transparency of the benefits we offer; and to consistently exceed our customers’ expectations. \\nAs a result, we have earned a higher level of trust amongst our customers than any other utility supplier, \\nconsistent endorsements from Which? in their regular surveys, and a Net Promoter Score that typically \\nfluctuates between +40 and +45 on a monthly basis.\\nThe steps we have taken over the last few years to improve our customer service and the quality of our \\ncustomer base have led to a continuing progressive reduction in both our levels of churn and the proportion \\nof Members who are delinquent (ie: have at least two outstanding bills). Our bad debt charge for the year \\nremained at 1.5% of revenue (2013: 1.5%), even though a significant number of new Members joined \\nduring the year.\\nROUTE TO MARKET\\nThe number of new Partners joining the business during the year averaged around 1,300 per month (2013: \\n1,002), taking the total number of registered Partners at the year end to a record high of over 44,000 \\n(2013: 39,848).\\nWe believe the continuing high level of interest in joining our business is being driven by the combination \\nof continuing pressure on household budgets, growing awareness of our brand, and the attractiveness of \\nthe secure part-time additional income opportunity we offer. We have enhanced the personal development \\nprogramme we offer to help new Partners get started more quickly, promote our services more effectively, \\nand build a growing long-term residual income. \\nConfidence and morale amongst our partners is currently extremely high, following our recent annual sales \\nconference in March which saw a record attendance. We are delighted with the positive reaction we have \\nseen to the range of new tools we introduced, and the boost this has given to the strong momentum we \\nwere already seeing.\\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\\nThe UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) encourages the Chairman to report personally on how \\nthe principles in the Code relating to the role and effectiveness of the Board have been applied.\\nAs a Board we are responsible to the Company’s shareholders for delivering sustainable shareholder value \\nover the long term through effective management and good governance. A key role of mine, as Executive \\nChairman, is to provide strong leadership to enable the Board to operate effectively. \\nWe believe that open and rigorous debate around key strategic issues and risks faced by the Company is \\nimportant in achieving our objectives and the Company is fortunate to have non-executive directors with \\ndiverse and extensive business experience who actively contribute to these discussions. \\nFurther detail of the Company’s governance processes and compliance with the Code is set out in the \\nCorporate Governance Statement. \\nCHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT \\nCONTINUED  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\n \\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 9\\nOUTLOOK\\nRecent Trading\\nA record number of Partners attended our annual sales conference in March, where we launched a range \\nof new tools to help them build their businesses more effectively. These resulted in an immediate uplift in \\nactivity by our Partners, as announced in our trading update on 4 April 2014; we are delighted that this \\nmomentum continued throughout April, taking the total number of new Partners recruited since our sales \\nconference to over 5,000.\\nThe combination of record numbers of new Partners requiring training for the first time, and existing \\nPartners wanting to repeat their training so they could fully understand how to take advantage of the new \\ntools we had announced means we have provided 8,000 training places since late March to cope with the \\nincreased demand – this is around four times the number of places usually required. \\nThe backlog this created has now been cleared, and customer gathering activity is starting to show an \\nimprovement over what were already extremely healthy levels. If current trends continue, the number of \\nservices we provide will show further significant net growth over the course of the year, with our customer \\nbase increasing to around 600,000 by the end of the year.\\nEnergy Prices\\nWithin the energy sector as a whole, significant investment is needed over the next decade to renew and \\nextend the distribution network, replace nuclear and coal-fired generating plant that is approaching the \\nend of its useful life, roll out smart meters, and encourage the take up of energy efficiency and renewable \\nenergy programmes. The costs associated with delivering these initiatives are likely to put continued upward \\npressure on retail energy prices over the medium term, irrespective of any movements in wholesale energy \\ncommodity costs, although these may be partially offset by the shifting of certain social and environmental \\ncosts from consumer bills into general taxation.\\nRegulatory\\nThe proposals set out in Ofgem’s Retail Market Review have now been implemented. These include a \\nprovision requiring each supplier to inform their customers (on each bill they receive) of any cheaper tariffs \\navailable, which is intended to make it more difficult for suppliers to cross-subsidise attractive acquisition \\ntariffs by overcharging their legacy customer base. We anticipate benefitting from these new disclosure \\nrequirements, as customers receive this additional information on future bills from our competitors over the \\ncourse of the next 12 months. In the meantime, our tariffs, bills and marketing are all fully compliant with \\nthe new licence conditions.\\nThe forthcoming review by the Competition and Markets Authority is focussed on the ‘Big 6’ energy \\nsuppliers, and in particular whether their vertically integrated structure is acting against the public interest. \\nAs such, we do not expect it to have any adverse impact on us as the leading independent supplier. It \\nshould be noted that our wholesale energy supply arrangements with Npower are expected to largely \\ninsulate us against any margin pressure from the proposed 20-month price freeze likely to be included in \\nthe Labour Party manifesto for the forthcoming election. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 10\\nProspects\\nOur Partners continue to demonstrate their ability to gather high quality new Members in substantial \\nvolumes, and the high proportion of new Members taking all five of our core services (now running at \\naround 25%) is particularly encouraging.\\nHaving reached the 500,000 customer milestone a few months ago, our focus now is on doubling this \\nto one million customers and beyond over the medium term; this would represent a UK market share of \\nless than 4%, and seems eminently achievable given our track record of consistently delivering 15%-\\n20% annual growth in the number of services we supply over the last few years. Current high levels of \\nconfidence amongst our existing Partners, and the record numbers of new Partners who have joined the \\nbusiness since our sales conference in March, give us confidence that these strong rates of organic growth \\nare sustainable going forward.\\nThe steadily improving quality of our customer base gives us good visibility over future revenues and \\nmargins on the various services we provide, and our adjusted pre-tax profits for the current year will show \\na significant increase over last year’s reported numbers, reflecting both the strong organic customer growth \\nwe have achieved over the last 12 months, combined with the financial benefits of the transaction with \\nNpower we completed in December. \\nWe remain comfortable with market expectations for adjusted pre-tax profits for the current year of £63m, \\nan increase of almost 50% on last year. As a result, shareholders can look forward to progressive growth \\nin the level of our dividends, notwithstanding that we will be repaying £20m of debt over the course of the \\ncurrent year.\\nIt only remains for me to thank my boardroom colleagues for their support and all our staff and Partners for \\ntheir loyalty and hard work during the past year, and to wish each and every one of them success in the \\nyears to come.\\nCharles Wigoder\\nExecutive Chairman\\n20 May 2014\\nCHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT \\nCONTINUED  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\n \\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 11\\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW\\nMARKETS\\nWe supply a wide range of essential utility services (Gas, Electricity, Landline, Broadband and Mobile) \\nto both domestic and small business customers; these are all substantial markets and represent a vast \\nopportunity for further organic growth.\\nThe markets we operate in are dominated by a relatively small number of former monopoly suppliers and \\nother owners of infrastructure assets, although in each there are also a number of independent suppliers \\ncarving out their own niches, generally based on price. \\nBUSINESS MODEL\\nThe Utility Warehouse has a fundamentally different business model to any other utility provider in the UK in \\nthree key respects:\\n•  firstly, we provide our services through the Utility Warehouse Discount Club, in which each customer \\nbecomes a Member;\\n•   secondly, we are the only fully integrated provider of both energy and communications services, with a \\nsingle set of overheads that we can spread across our multiple revenue streams; and \\n•  thirdly, we have a unique route to market, with an ‘army’ of over 44,000 part-time self-employed \\nPartners. This means that instead of seeking to attract new Members through expensive advertising on \\ntelevision or in the national press, direct marketing, or price comparison sites, we instead benefit from \\ngenuine personal recommendations by both our Partners, and also by existing Members.\\nPartners can earn a small percentage of the monthly revenues generated by any Members gathered, either \\npersonally, or by someone in their team. On a similar basis, Members are directly rewarded with shopping \\nvouchers when they introduce a new Member, and receive additional vouchers annually in December \\nprovided the Member(s) they have introduced are still using our services. \\nWe continue to invest heavily in our bespoke IT systems; these enable us to integrate all the services we \\nsupply into a single monthly bill, supported by just one set of central overheads (including all administrative \\nand customer service functions). This highly efficient cost base is a key factor in enabling us to offer \\nattractive pricing and a wide range of valuable benefits to our Members, a secure residual income to our \\nPartners, and a growing dividend stream to shareholders.\\nOur business model requires us to provide exceptional customer service in order to convert our Members \\ninto fans, and ensure our Partners have the confidence to recommend us to their friends and family. We are \\nextremely pleased with the further progress we have made this year towards achieving these goals, and in \\nsecuring our position as the Nation’s most trusted utility provider.\\nSTRATEGY\\nOur strategy is to build on the current strong levels of organic growth we are achieving, in order to \\nprogressively increase our share of the markets in which we operate. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 12\\nWe will achieve this by maintaining our focus on delivering best-in-class customer service, investing in \\nour systems and staff, simplifying and, where possible, improving the competitiveness of our services \\neven further, encouraging existing Members to talk about the unique benefits we offer to their friends and \\nacquaintances, and making it easier for our Partners to promote our services more effectively.\\nWe continue to explore the possibility of expanding our current range of core services into areas where \\nwe can leverage our existing strong relationship with our Members to offer them improved service and \\nbetter value on services they currently obtain from other suppliers, whilst also delivering a satisfactory return \\nfor our shareholders. Potential additional services include water, television and/or a range of insurance \\nproducts (eg: home and motor policies).\\nOPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND NON-FINANCIAL KPIs\\nOur overall performance for the year has been extremely encouraging in a number of key respects:\\n•  continuing strong organic growth with service numbers up by 305,100 (2013: 221,037)\\n•  lower chur n\\n•  lower delinquency\\n•  growing proportion of Members taking all five of our core services\\n•  significant increase in the number of new Partners\\n•  positive reviews and recognition from Which? for both energy and telephony services\\n•  consistently high Net Promoter Scores \\nAgainst the background of a broadly flat economy, and with household incomes remaining under pressure, \\nour value-based consumer proposition and the part-time income opportunity we offer are extremely \\nattractive to both Members and Partners respectively.\\nOur continuing strong organic growth is underpinned by high levels of confidence amongst our Partners \\nin our brand and financial strength, the good value provided by our services, and our commitment to \\ndelivering best-in-class customer service. \\nCustomers\\nCUSTOMER GROUP 2014 2013\\nResidential Club 495,234 425,118\\nBusiness Club 29,098 28,313           \\nTOTAL CLUB 524,332 453,431                              \\nTML 6,307 7,601                           \\nTOTAL GROUP 530,639 461,032                 \\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW\\nCONTINUED  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\n \\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 13\\nOur customer base can be split into three groups as set out in the above table, each of which has different \\ncharacteristics:\\n(i)  Residential customers who are Members of the Utility Warehouse Discount Club (93.3% of our \\ncustomers) taking on average 3.64 services from us;\\n(ii)    Small businesses who are Members of the Utility Warehouse Discount Club for Business (5.5% of our \\ncustomers) taking on average 2.74 services from us; and\\n(iii)  Other small businesses signed up through our wholly owned Telecommunications Management \\nLimited (“TML”) subsidiary (1.2% of our customers) taking on average 3.56 services from us. These \\ncustomers are no longer considered a core part of the business, and their contribution is becoming \\nprogressively less material in the context of the Group.\\nWithin the residential Club, there is a further difference in quality (and therefore in the revenues and profits \\nthey will generate over the time they remain a Club Member) between Members, depending on whether \\nthey are a homeowner, and on the number of services we provide to them. We are therefore pleased \\nthat against the backdrop of an increasing national trend towards renting, the proportion of homeowners \\namongst new Members has remained broadly steady at around 75%, and the proportion of new Members \\ntaking all five of our core services has increased significantly compared with the previous year:\\nPERCENTAGE OF NEW RESIDENTIAL CLUB MEMBERS TAKING FIVE CORE SERVICES\\n24.4% Q4 FY14\\n16.3% Q3 FY14\\n13.2% Q2 FY14\\n13.3% Q1 FY14\\nAlthough on average a new Member taking all five of our core services requires a greater initial investment, \\nthese Members benefit from our most competitive prices, generate higher commission for our Partners, and \\nprovide the greatest lifetime value to the Company.\\nOverall churn within our customer base has continued to fall.

This increase means penetration of Mobile within our residential Club has risen from \\n12.5% to 23.7% over the last three years as a result of our continuing investment in making this service \\nmore attractive to Members. With around 35% of new Members taking this service, there remains \\nsignificant scope for further improvement in this level of penetration over the next few years. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 16\\nCashBack card\\nOur exclusive CashBack card has proven itself as an important Member acquisition and retention tool. It \\ngives our Members the opportunity to achieve additional savings of between 3% and 7% on their shopping \\nat a wide range of participating retailers, which they receive as a credit on their next monthly bill from us.\\nWe have seen a 19% increase during the year in the number of cards in issue to 139,769 (2013: 117,025), \\nwith a little under one third of new residential Club Members applying for a card. We believe this steady \\nlevel of demand is a reflection of the continuing challenging economic climate, where many new Members \\nfind it difficult to fund the switch from paying in arrears on their credit card, to paying for their purchases in \\nadvance with a prepayment card.\\nWe paid over £4.6m (2013: £4.4m) in CashBack to our Members during the year (funded entirely by the \\nretailers in the programme), with many Members achieving a reduction of between 20% and 30% on the \\namount they pay for the utilities we are supplying to them each month, simply by using their CashBack card \\n(instead of an alternative payment card) for most of their regular household shopping.\\nCustomer Service\\nWe pride ourselves on delivering first-class service to our Members through a single call centre based in the \\nUK. We try to ensure where possible that the first person a Member speaks to is able to resolve any issues \\nthey may have with their multi-utility account.\\nWe have a relentless focus on improving the service experience we deliver to our Members; we readily \\ninvest in technology that we believe will genuinely achieve this objective, and continually assess the \\nnumerous qualitative and quantitative performance measurement tools that we employ to monitor all aspects \\nof our Members’ interactions with us in order to ensure the overall quality of their experience. \\nWe have been delighted at the consistently high customer service ratings we receive in Which? magazine, \\nand the overwhelmingly positive feedback we receive from Members in our own surveys.\\nPartners\\nOur Partners are one of the key strengths of our business. In contrast to the routes to market adopted by \\nother suppliers of essential household services, the alignment of financial interest provided by our revenue-\\nsharing model, the structure of our compensation plan, and the substantial number of Partners who hold \\nequity or share options in the Company, incentivise them to focus their activities on finding creditworthy \\nhigher-spending customers who will reap the maximum savings from using our services, and will thus be \\nleast likely to churn; by doing so, they maximise their own long-term income. This ensures that cases of mis-\\nselling are generally both inadvertent and extremely rare.\\nWe provide a variety of training and personal development courses both online and classroom based, \\ndesigned to provide the skills and knowledge they need to gather Members and recruit other Partners \\neffectively and successfully; all of these courses are free to attend.

In absolute \\nterms they increased by £1.0m as a result of higher payments to Partners arising from our continuing strong \\norganic growth and the higher revenue we achieved for the year. \\nAdministrative expenses increased during the year by £7.0m to £41.6m (2013: £34.6m) as a result of \\nhigher staff costs, an increase in bank charges relating to our new debt facilities with Barclays, greater \\ntelephony costs (following our decision to introduce a freephone 0800 number for customer services), and \\nthe one-off costs associated with the energy Retail Market Review.\\nAdjusted earnings per share increased by 26.8% to 50.6p (2013: 39.9p). In accordance with previous \\nguidance and our strong cash position, the Company is proposing to pay a final dividend of 19p (2013: \\n18p) per share, making a total dividend of 35p (2013: 31p) per share for the year.\\nMARGINS\\nOur overall gross margin for the year was slightly above previous guidance at 15.2% (2013: 13.9%) \\nas a direct consequence of our new energy supply arrangements with Npower which were completed in  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\n \\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 19\\nDecember 2013. We are therefore updating our guidance on gross profit margins, and now expect them to \\nbe within a range of 15% to 17% (previously 13% to 15%) for the foreseeable future. \\nCUSTOMER MANAGEMENT BUSINESS\\nOur customer management business delivered record growth of over 300,000 services during the year, \\nmaking eleven consecutive quarters in which we have delivered net growth of over 50,000 services: \\nNET GROWTH IN SERVICES \\n57,957 Q4 FY14\\n81,429 Q3 FY14\\n101,447 Q2 FY14\\n64,267 Q1 FY14\\n57,827 Q4 FY13\\n55,488 Q3 FY13\\n54,406 Q2 FY13\\n53,316 Q1 FY13\\n58,855 Q4 FY12\\n51,529 Q3 FY12\\n61,363 Q2 FY12\\n38,140 Q1 FY12\\nThe consistency of these numbers reflects our continuing focus on making it easier for our Partners to gather \\nnew members by simplifying our processes, improving membership benefits, making our services more \\ncompetitive, and improving our customer service. As a result, all our core services are now seeing strong \\nmonthly growth.\\nThe particularly high growth in service numbers during Q2 and Q3 last year was due to exceptionally \\nfavourable market conditions and strong promotional activity, and should not be interpreted as a precedent \\nfor similar seasonal outperformance in these periods in future years.\\nThe progressive improvement in the quality of our customer base, with lower levels of delinquency and \\na steady increase in the average number of services being taken by each customer, has resulted in a \\nprogressive reduction in both churn and bad debts over the last four years.

We installed \\n8,958 of them during the year (2013: 6,584), many of them at the customer’s own request, which \\nhelped grow our base of prepayment meters to 50,095 (2013: 33,563) representing approximately \\n5.8% of the energy services we supply.

Personnel expenses (excluding the non-cash accounting cost of share incentive \\nschemes) increased by 20.8% during the year to £23.8m (2013: £19.7m), as we continue to strengthen \\nour management team. \\nOther year-on-year adverse movements in administrative expenses included an increase in bank charges \\nrelating to our new debt facilities with Barclays, greater telephony costs (following our decision to introduce \\na freephone 0800 number for customer services), and the one-off costs associated with the energy Retail \\nMarket Review. \\nOverall, administrative expenses represented 6.3% of revenue for the year (2013: 5.8%), mainly due to \\nsubstantially lower spend by Members on their energy during an exceptionally mild winter. We continue to \\nlook for efficiency savings throughout the business to maximise economies of scale as we continue to grow. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 22\\nOPUS \\nOur share of the profits from Opus Energy Group Limited (“Opus”), in which we maintain a 20% stake, \\nincreased during the year to £4.7m (2013: £3.4m). This excellent result reflects a continuing strong trading \\nperformance, and the further steady progress they have made in supplying gas alongside electricity into the \\nsmall business and corporate sector, for which they are now buying renewable energy from over 500 small \\nUK generators. Opus revenues increased by 17.6% to just over £434m (2013: £369m) and profit before \\ntax increased from £22.4m to £30.2m.\\nWe remain encouraged by the resilience of the business model and the strength and experience of the Opus \\nmanagement team, and expect to receive a dividend of approximately £4.1m in July 2014. Our shareholding \\nin Opus is valued on our balance sheet at £8.8m in line with standard accounting policy, notwithstanding the \\nlikelihood that its market value is substantially in excess of this figure; we are extremely pleased to have such \\nsignificant exposure to this rapidly growing, profitable and highly cash generative business.\\nNEW ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS \\nIn December 2013 we improved the commercial terms of our energy supply arrangements with Npower by \\nacquiring Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited for a total consideration of £218m (of \\nwhich £21.5m is deferred for three years).\\nTo fund this transaction and other working capital requirements associated with our recent rapid organic \\ngrowth, we raised £130m of equity from shareholders and £100m of debt from Barclays Bank. The debt is \\ndue to be repaid over three years, as set out in note 12 to the financial statements on page 100.\\nThis transaction has given rise to the creation of a significant intangible asset in the balance sheet of the \\nGroup. In accordance with the relevant accounting standards, we will be amortising it on a straight-line \\nbasis over the 20 year life of the new energy supply arrangements. As this amortisation is a non-cash item, \\nand unrelated to the underlying trading performance of the business, the financial results on which we will \\nbe focussing each year will exclude any impact from this amortisation. \\nCASH, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL\\nOur cash balances at the year-end increased to £45.4m (2013: £3.4m). This reflects continuing strong \\nunderlying operational cash generation, combined with advance funding from Npower to cover various industry \\nrelated costs which they were paying directly prior to the new energy supply agreement coming into effect.\\nCash outflows are expected to be significantly higher this year, as we complete the £20m refurbishment \\nof our new headquarters office building, support our distribution channel with branded BMW Minis and \\nTablets, and fund growing demand from customers for ‘free’ Smartphones. Facilities have been arranged \\nwith Barclays Bank to enable us to fund these costs without affecting our progressive dividend policy.\\nWe anticipate a modest rise in our working capital requirements over the next two years due to a number \\nof factors: (i) the costs associated with funding the growth in our mobile business (where increasing \\nnumbers of customers are choosing to be provided with a premium mobile handset, which they can obtain \\nfrom us with no upfront cost on a 24 month contract; (ii) an increase in the number of BMW Minis supplied \\nto Partners on hire purchase agreements; and (iii) the cost of providing them with Tablets (on 30 months \\ninterest-free credit) to help them build their businesses more effectively. \\nUnder the terms of the new energy supply arrangements Npower remains responsible for funding the \\nworking capital requirements associated with our energy budget plan customers.\\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\\nCONTINUED  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\n \\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 23\\nBORROWINGS \\nOur balance sheet at the year end shows a net debt position of £53.6m (2013: net cash £0.8m) which \\nprincipally reflects the impact of the £100m we borrowed from Barclays to help fund the recent transaction \\nwith Npower. \\nDIVIDEND \\nThe final dividend of 19p per share (2013: 18p) will be paid on 1 August 2014 to shareholders on \\nthe register at the close of business on 18 July 2014 and is subject to approval by shareholders at the \\nCompany’s Annual General Meeting which will be held on 15 July 2014. This makes a total dividend \\npayable for the year of 35p (2013: 31p).\\nWe remain firmly committed to a progressive dividend policy, but the level of distributions to shareholders \\nfor the current year will need to reflect the impact of starting to repay the borrowings we arranged in \\nDecember to part-fund our recent transaction with Npower. Our current expectation is that the total \\ndividend for the current year will therefore increase by around 15%, and thereafter that further growth \\nin earnings from the level we achieve this year should be reflected in a corresponding rise in the level of \\ndistributions to shareholders.\\nSHARE INCENTIVE SCHEME CHARGES\\nOperating profit is stated after share incentive scheme charges of £4.2m (2013: £0.9m). These expenses \\nrelate to an accounting charge under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments (“IFRS 2”). \\nAs a result of the increasing relative importance of share incentive scheme charges as a proportion \\nof our pre-tax profits, we are separately disclosing this amount within the Consolidated Statement of \\nComprehensive Income for the period (and excluding these charges from our calculation of adjusted profits \\nand earnings). The increase in this charge mainly reflects the strong rise in the Company’s share price \\nduring the financial year, and therefore separate disclosure is considered appropriate so that the underlying \\nperformance of the business can be clearly identified. \\nIn accordance with IFRS 2, awards made under the Company’s JSOP share incentive scheme are deemed \\nto be cash-settled. However, whilst approximately £3.4m (2013: £0.4m) of the share incentive scheme \\ncharges during the year relate to JSOP awards, and could therefore be settled in cash, in practice it is \\nexpected that any settlement of awards under the JSOP will be made in equity. Our current earnings per \\nshare have therefore been adjusted to eliminate these share incentive scheme charges.\\nTAXATION\\nA full analysis of the taxation charge for the year is set out in note 4 to the financial statements. The tax \\ncharge for the year is £7.7m (2013: £7.6m). \\nThe effective tax rate for the year was 20.9% (2013: 21.8%).\\nChris Houghton\\nFinance Director\\n20 May 2014\\n  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 24\\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES \\nBACKGROUND\\nThe Group faces various risk factors, both internal and external, which could have a material impact on \\nlong-term performance. However, the Group’s underlying business model is considered relatively low-\\nrisk, with no need for management to take any disproportionate risks in order to preserve or generate \\nshareholder value.\\nThe Group continues to develop and operate a consistent and systematic risk management process, which \\ninvolves risk ranking, prioritisation and subsequent evaluation, with a view to ensuring all significant risks \\nhave been identified, prioritised and (where possible) eliminated, and that systems of control are in place to \\nmanage any remaining risks. \\nA formal document is prepared by the executive directors and senior management team on a regular basis \\ndetailing the key risks faced by the Group and the operational controls in place to mitigate those risks; this \\ndocument is then reviewed by the Audit Committee.\\nBUSINESS MODEL\\nThe principal risks outlined below should be viewed in the context of the Group’s business model as a \\nreseller of utility services (gas, electricity, fixed line telephony, mobile telephony and broadband internet) \\nunder the Utility Warehouse and TML brands. As a reseller, the Group does not own any of the network \\ninfrastructure required to deliver its services to customers. This means that while the Group is heavily reliant \\non third party providers, it is insulated from all the direct risks associated with owning and/or operating \\nsuch capital intensive infrastructure itself.  \\nThe Group’s services are promoted using ‘word of mouth’ by a large network of independent Partners, who \\nare paid solely on a commission basis. This means that the Group has minimal fixed costs associated with \\nacquiring new customers.\\nThe principal specific risks arising from the Group’s business model, and the measures taken to mitigate \\nthose risks, are set out below:\\nREPUTATIONAL RISK\\nThe Group’s reputation amongst its customers, suppliers and Partners is believed to be fundamental to the \\nfuture success of the Group. Failure to meet expectations in terms of the services provided by the Group, \\nthe way the Group does business or in the Group’s financial performance could have a material negative \\nimpact on the Group’s performance.\\nIn relation to customer service, reputational risk is principally mitigated through the Group’s recruitment \\nprocesses, a focus on closely monitoring staff performance, including the use of direct customer feedback \\nsurveys (Net Promoter Score), and through the provision of rigorous staff training. \\nResponsibility for maintaining effective relationships with suppliers and Partners rests primarily with the \\nappropriate member of the Group’s senior management team with responsibility for the relevant area. Any \\nmaterial changes to supplier agreements and Partner commission arrangements which could impact the Group’s \\nrelationships are generally negotiated by the executive Directors and ultimately approved by the full Board. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\n \\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 25\\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RISK\\nThe Group is dependent on its proprietary billing and customer management software for the  \\nsuccessful operation of its business model. This software is developed and maintained in accordance with \\nthe changing needs of the business by a team of highly skilled, long-standing, motivated and experienced \\nindividuals.\\nAll significant changes which are made to the billing and customer management software are tested as \\nextensively as reasonably practical before launch and are ultimately approved by the heads of the IT and \\nBilling departments in consultation with the Chief Executive as appropriate. \\nBack-ups of both the software and underlying billing and customer data are made on a regular basis  \\nand securely stored off-site. The Group also has extensive back-up information technology infrastructure in \\nthe event of a failure of the main system, designed to ensure that a near-seamless service to customers can \\nbe maintained.\\nLEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY RISK\\nThe Group is subject to varying laws and regulations, including possible adverse effects from European \\nregulatory intervention. The energy markets in the UK and Continental Europe are subject to comprehensive \\noperating requirements as defined by the relevant sector regulators and/or government departments. \\nAmendments to the regulatory regime could have an impact on the Group’s ability to achieve its financial \\ngoals. Furthermore, the Group is obliged to comply with retail supply procedures, amendments to which \\ncould have an impact on operating costs.\\nThe Group is a licensed gas and electricity supplier, and therefore has a direct regulatory relationship \\nwith Ofgem. If the Group fails to maintain an effective relationship with Ofgem and comply with its licence \\nobligations, it could be subject to fines or to the removal of its respective licences.\\nRecent regulatory changes such as the new requirements in relation to smart energy meters (with the \\npotential for additional costs if existing meters must be replaced prior to the end of their planned lives) and \\nsocial tariffs, and changes to the current decommissioning regime could all have a potentially significant \\nimpact on the sector, although any additional costs associated with smart metering are not expected to \\naffect the net margins earned by energy suppliers (as any such extra costs are likely to be reflected in \\nhigher retail charges). \\nIn general, the majority of the Group’s services are supplied into highly regulated markets, and this \\ncould restrict the operational flexibility of the Group’s business. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group \\nmaintains an appropriate relationship with both Ofgem and Ofcom (the UK regulators for the energy and \\ncommunications markets respectively) and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (“DECC”). The \\nGroup engages with officials from all these organisations on a periodic basis to ensure they are aware of \\nthe Group’s views when they are consulting on proposed regulatory changes or if there are competition \\nissues the Group needs to raise with them.\\nHowever, it should be noted that the regulatory environment for the various markets in which the Group \\noperates is generally focussed on promoting competition. As one of the new entrants, it seems reasonable \\nto expect that most such changes will broadly be beneficial to the Group, given the Group’s relatively  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 26\\nsmall size compared to the former monopoly incumbents with whom it competes, although these changes, \\nand their actual impact, remain uncertain at present. Furthermore, the governmental focus on reform of \\nthe energy market and the recently announced investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority, \\nappears to be targeted at the large vertically integrated suppliers, with consideration being given to the \\ndesirability of breaking the link between energy generation and retail supply.\\nPolitical and consumer concern over rising energy prices and fuel poverty may lead to further reviews of the \\nenergy market which could result in further consumer protection legislation being introduced through energy \\nsupply licences. The Government could also choose to introduce adverse measures such as a windfall \\ntax on the Group or price controls for certain customer segments. In addition, political and regulatory \\ndevelopments affecting the energy markets within which the Group operates may have a material adverse \\neffect on the Group’s business, results of operations and overall financial condition, although the proposed \\nLabour Party energy price freeze for 20 months following the forthcoming election is not expected to put \\npressure on the margins of the Group if implemented.\\nFINANCING RISK\\nAs a result of the recent transaction with Npower, the Group has entered into new debt facilities leading \\nto increased debt service obligations which may place operating and financial restrictions on the Group. \\nThis debt could have adverse consequences insofar as it: (a) requires the Group to dedicate a material \\nproportion of its cash flows from operations to fund payments in respect of the debt, thereby reducing the \\nflexibility of the Group to utilise its cash to invest in and/or grow the business; (b) increases the Group’s \\nvulnerability to adverse general economic and/or industry conditions; (c) may limit the Group’s flexibility \\nin planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business or the industry in which it operates; (d) may limit the \\nGroup’s ability to raise additional debt in the long term; and (e) could restrict the Group from making larger \\nstrategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities.\\nEach of these prospective adverse consequences (or a combination of some or all of them) could result in \\nthe potential growth of the Group being at a slower rate than may otherwise be achieved.\\nFRAUD AND BAD DEBT RISK \\nThe Group has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers. \\nThis means that although the Group is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from potential new customers \\nwho are not considered creditworthy, the Group is obliged to supply domestic energy to everyone who \\nsubmits a properly completed application form. Where customers subsequently fail to pay for the energy \\nthey have used (“Delinquent Customers”), there is likely to be a considerable delay before the Group \\nis able to control its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter or \\ndisconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such Delinquent Customers from \\nincreasing their indebtedness are not always fully recovered.\\nFraud within the telephony industry may arise from customers using the services without intending to pay \\ntheir supplier. The amounts involved are generally relatively small as the Group has sophisticated call traffic \\nmonitoring systems to identify material occurrences of fraud. The Group is able to immediately eliminate \\nany further bad debt exposure by disconnecting any telephony service that demonstrates a suspicious \\nusage profile, or falls into arrears on payments.\\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES \\nCONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\n \\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 27\\nMore generally, the Group is also exposed to payment card fraud, where customers use stolen cards to obtain \\ncredit (e.g. on their CashBack card) or goods (e.g. Smartphones and Tablets) from the Group; the Group \\nregularly reviews and refines its fraud protection systems to reduce its potential exposure to such risks.\\nWHOLESALE PRICES RISK\\nThe Group does not own or operate any utility network infrastructure itself, choosing instead to purchase \\nthe capacity needed from third parties. The advantage of this approach is that the Group is protected from \\ntechnological risk, capacity risk or the risk of obsolescence, as it can purchase the amount of each service \\nrequired to meet its customers’ needs. \\nWhilst there is a theoretical risk that in some of the areas in which the Group operates it may be unable \\nto secure access to the necessary infrastructure on commercially attractive terms, in practice the pricing of \\naccess to such infrastructure is either regulated (as in the energy market) or subject to significant competitive \\npressures (as in telephony and broadband). The profile of the Group’s customers, the significant quantities of \\neach service they consume in aggregate, and its clearly differentiated route to market has historically proven \\nattractive to potential partners, who compete aggressively to secure a share of the Group’s growing business.\\nThe supply of energy, which accounts for an increasing proportion of sales each year, has different  \\nrisks associated with it. The wholesale price can be extremely volatile, and customer demand can be \\nsubject to considerable short term fluctuations depending on the weather. The Group has a long-standing \\nsupply relationship with Npower under which the latter assumes the substantive risks and rewards of \\nhedging and buying energy for the Group’s customers. If the Group did not have the benefit of this long \\nterm supply agreement it would be exposed to the pricing risk of securing access to the necessary energy \\non the open market.\\nCOMPETITIVE RISK\\nThe Group operates in highly competitive markets and significant service innovations or increased price \\ncompetition could impact future profit margins. In order to maintain its competitive position, there is a \\nconsistent focus on ways of improving operational efficiency and keeping the cost base as low as possible. \\nNew service innovations are monitored closely by senior management and the Group is typically able to \\nrespond rapidly by offering any new services using the infrastructure of its existing suppliers. The Group \\noffers a unique multiservice proposition. The increasing proportion of customers who are benefiting from \\na genuine multi-utility solution, that is unavailable from any other known supplier, materially reduces any \\ncompetitive threat.\\nThe Directors anticipate that the Group will face continued competition in the future as the market grows, \\nnew companies enter the market and alternative technologies and services become available. The Group’s \\nservices and expertise may be rendered obsolete or uneconomic by technological advances or novel \\napproaches developed by one or more of the Group’s competitors. The existing approaches of the Group’s \\ncompetitors or new approaches or technologies developed by such competitors may be more effective \\nor affordable than those supplied to the Group. There can be no assurance that the Group’s competitors \\nwill not develop more effective or more affordable technologies or services, thus rendering the Group’s \\ntechnologies and/or services obsolete, uncompetitive or uneconomical. There can be no assurance that the \\nGroup will be able to compete successfully with existing or potential competitors or that competitive factors  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 28\\nwill not have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. \\nHowever, as the Group’s customer base continues to rise, competition amongst suppliers of services to \\nthe Group is expected to increase. This has already been evidenced by various volume-related growth \\nincentives which have been agreed with the Group’s three largest wholesale suppliers. This should ensure \\nthat the Group has direct access to new technologies and services available to the market. \\nINFRASTRUCTURE RISK\\nThe provision of services to the Group’s customers is reliant on the efficient operation of third party physical \\ninfrastructure. There is a risk of disruption to the supply of services to customers through any failure in \\nthe infrastructure e.g. gas shortages, power cuts or damage to communications networks. However, \\nas the infrastructure is generally shared with other suppliers, any material disruption to the supply of \\nservices is likely to impact a large part of the market as a whole and it is unlikely that the Group would \\nbe disproportionately affected. In the event of any prolonged disruption isolated to the Group’s principal \\nsupplier within a particular market, services required by customers could be sourced from another provider.\\n \\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES \\nCONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\n \\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 29\\nPEOPLE AND ORGANISATION\\nEMPLOYEES\\nWe rely on the combined efforts of around 740 employees to manage relationships with both our Members \\nand Partners, and deliver a consistently high quality of service at all times. We pay considerable attention \\nto recruiting, developing and retaining people with appropriate skills.\\nWe continue to recruit new members of staff through our own Assessment Centre designed to give the \\nCompany greater control over the recruitment process and to ensure we select the very best candidates for \\nour positions. Once they have joined, new starters go through a structured training programme to ensure \\nthat they are fully equipped to resolve any customer queries and to provide the high level of customer \\nservice that we demand. Everyone who successfully completes this programme celebrates their achievement \\nat a quarterly graduation ceremony, where they are presented with a certificate and champagne by the \\nChief Executive.\\nThe combination of valuing and developing our staff, our service-oriented culture and the day-to-day \\nreinforcement of our core values are key competitive advantages in enabling us to attract and retain a \\nmotivated, talented and diverse workforce. \\nWe continue to invest in our people, and have comprehensive Manager and Supervisor development \\nprogrammes, which are accompanied by selective executive coaching. We have introduced an online \\nlearning portal to assist in the development of all our employees, and make available a wide range of \\n‘Skills Builder Courses’ in addition to e-learning modules. We promote from within where possible into both \\nspecialist and managerial roles. \\nOur monthly Employee Recognition Awards enable the Company to celebrate and reward employees who \\nhave gone ‘over and above’ in the performance of their role. \\nWe actively seek to engage all our employees in changes that may concern them, rather than just a \\nrepresentative few on a committee. An example of this was while we were rolling out a workforce \\nmanagement system recently, when all members of staff were engaged in group discussions. Also, when we \\nintroduced our Mission Statement to become the Nation’s most trusted utility company, we collaborated with \\neach department in dialogue groups to help them frame their own personal mission statements. We monitor \\nemployee engagement with an internal Staff Survey, which shows high levels of satisfaction; this year \\n90% of employees who responded stated that they enjoy working for the Company. We keep employees \\ninformed on a regular basis of the financial performance of the business and other matters of potential \\nconcern to them, through the Company intranet, ad hoc emails, the monthly Company newsletter and \\nquarterly breakfast forums with the Chief Executive.\\nWe operate an ‘open-door’ policy throughout the business, provide employees with various mechanisms for \\nproviding feedback and making suggestions, and include open ended questions within the staff survey. \\nWe have an active staff social committee which organises a wide range of events, supported by the \\nCompany, including the annual summer and Christmas parties, poker evenings, quiz nights and many other \\nad hoc fun events. This year, to mark reaching half a million customers, a week of fun celebrations was \\norganised for all our members of staff. We also have a ‘Fun Fund’ set aside for departmental social events. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 30\\nWe promote staff wellbeing, through an employee assistance helpline, subsidised on-site fitness classes, \\nperiodic at-desk massages, healthy meal options in the staff restaurant and a cycle to work scheme. Each \\nSeptember we run our ‘Fit Pig Week’ to promote health and well-being within the Company with a range of \\nfun events and incentives. This year we introduced a medical healthcare cash plan (‘Medicash’) allowing \\nemployees to obtain cover at a corporate rate.\\nWe continue to invest in our premises as necessary, to ensure the working environment is as attractive as \\npossible, consistent with the practical needs of running the business. With the exception of our logistics \\nteam, all our employees work together in Network HQ, our Head Office building in London. We operate a \\nheavily subsidised staff restaurant, and provide a recreation room in both our Head Office and warehouse \\npremises. We provide a wide range of other staff benefits including a significant discount on the services \\nwe provide, employee loans at preferential interest rates, a generous Christmas bonus scheme and \\nrecognition for five and 10 years’ service.\\nWe are pleased to report that average levels of staff absence this year remained below six days per year, \\nin line with the encouragingly low level we achieved during the preceding year.\\nThe Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved employee share option plan, under which \\nemployees are granted options to purchase shares in the Company which are exercisable between three \\nand ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price is the market price at the time of granting the \\noption. Our policy is to issue options to all employees after the satisfactory completion of their probationary \\nperiod, and additional options when 10 years’ service has been completed and in other appropriate \\ncircumstances (e.g. promotion). As at 31 March 2014 there were outstanding options over 1,418,833 \\nshares which had been granted to staff, representing approximately 1.8% of the issued share capital of the \\nCompany.\\nEmployees returning from maternity leave with children less than 12 months old are able to benefit from a \\ncompany contribution towards the cost of an external childcare service provider of their choice. We also \\nprovide facilities for staff to purchase childcare vouchers in a tax-efficient manner using a salary sacrifice \\nscheme, in accordance with HM Revenue and Customs guidelines.\\nWe encourage all employees to participate in a stakeholder pension scheme operated by Aviva. \\nParticipants can choose their own contribution level, which is matched by the Company within certain \\nlimits, depending on length of service. During the year we implemented pension auto-enrolment in \\naccordance with legislation and the Company is therefore now contributing to the pension funds of virtually \\nall employees, on a monthly basis.\\nWe actively facilitate ‘Access to Work’ grants for employees who have a disability, health or mental health \\ncondition providing the practical support to enable them to continue working effectively.\\nDIVERSITY\\nFull and fair consideration is given to opportunities for employment, training, career progression and \\npromotion on the basis of each individual’s ability, attitude and track record, irrespective of their gender, \\nethnic origin, nationality, age, religion, sexual orientation or disability.\\nPEOPLE AND ORGANISATION\\nCONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\n \\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 31\\nThe table below sets out a breakdown of the gender diversity at various levels within the organisation:\\n2014 2013\\nMALE FEMALE MALE FEMALE\\nBoard 6 - 6 -\\nSenior Managers 12 4 10 5\\nEmployees 434 286 369 254\\nThe Board’s position in relation to the Code requirement to set out measurable objectives in relation to \\nBoard diversity is set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 39.

This review was conducted by the Deputy Chairman and Company \\nSecretary and principally covered the following areas: specific matters of concern arising from the board \\nevaluation questionnaires, individual directors’ performances and key objectives for the coming year, and \\nthe identification of any specific training and development requirements.\\nThe evaluation questionnaires were focussed on assessing effectiveness in the following key areas:\\n•  the size and balance of the Board;\\n•  the quality of board debates and its decision making processes;\\n•  the individual contributions made by each director;\\n•  the Chairman’s approach to leadership;\\n•  the non-executive directors’ challenge of the executive directors;\\n•  the Board’s approach to identifying and mitigating key business risks;\\n•  the quality of the Company’s communications with key stakeholders; \\n•  the Board’s consideration of diversity and succession planning; and\\n•  the induction and training of board members. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 38\\nIn accordance with provision B.6.3 of the Code and building on the results of the evaluation questionnaires, \\nthe Deputy Chairman led a separate evaluation of the performance of the Chairman. This evaluation \\nprincipally comprised a review of the Chairman’s leadership style and tone in promoting effective decision-\\nmaking and ensuring constructive and sufficient debate took place around key issues. The results of this \\nevaluation were entirely satisfactory.\\nThe evaluation concluded that overall the Board and its Committees had operated well during the year, \\nwith all directors making an effective contribution to the Board commensurate with their experience and \\nresponsibilities. However, as was also the case in previous years, the evaluation identified that succession \\nplanning remained an area that needed to be given greater focus. \\nConsistent with the requirement of the Code to ensure a progressive refreshing of the Board, the \\nNomination Committee has therefore been tasked with developing a firm plan for independent non-\\nexecutive director succession over the coming year, to reflect the long service of both Michael Pavia and \\nMelvin Lawson since their appointment to the Board in late 2006. \\nBOARD BALANCE AND DIVERSITY\\nThe Board has remained unchanged during the year and consists of three executive directors and three \\nindependent non-executive directors. Julian Schild acts as the Company’s Deputy Chairman and Senior \\nIndependent Non-Executive Director. \\nMembership of each committee of the Board is set out in the table below:\\nNAME OF DIRECTOR REMUNERATION \\nCOMMITTEE\\nAUDIT \\nCOMMITTEE\\nNOMINATION \\nCOMMITTEE\\nCharles Wigoder - - 3\\nJulian Schild* Chairman 3 3\\nAndrew Lindsay - - -\\nChris Houghton - - -\\nMelvin Lawson* 3 3 -\\nMichael Pavia* 3 Chairman Chairman\\n* indicates independent non-executive directors\\nThe Board, in conjunction with the Nomination Committee, regularly reviews whether the composition of \\nthe Board and the diversity of its members remain appropriate in the light of the commercial challenges and \\nrisks facing the Company. \\nThe members of the Nomination Committee believe that the composition of the Board is currently \\nappropriate for the size of the Company and the nature of its operations which have not materially \\nchanged in scope since the prior year. However, the Committee appreciates that should the Company’s \\nsituation change in future, then the appointment of new directors to the Board may be required.\\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT\\nCONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 39\\nThe main objective of the Nomination Committee in considering the appointment of new directors to the \\nBoard, remains to ensure that successful candidates are of the highest calibre and demonstrate the best \\npossible combination of skills and experience. The Committee’s Terms of Reference further stipulate that \\ncandidates from a wide range of backgrounds shall be considered and that due regard will be given to the \\nbenefits of diversity on the Board.\\nNotwithstanding the Code requirement to set out measurable objectives in relation to Board diversity, it \\nremains the Committee’s strong view that it is not appropriate to stipulate the characteristics of any future \\ndirectors, including gender, ahead of a full assessment of the particular requirements of each role at the \\ntime a candidate is being sought. The Committee will continue to adhere to the principles set out above in \\nidentifying and recruiting the best candidates for any future Board roles in a non-discriminatory manner.\\nFurther detail regarding the Company’s position in relation to encouraging diversity within all layers of the \\norganisation is set out in the “People and Organisation” section of the Strategic Report on pages 29 to 31.\\nEXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\\nThere is a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the Company with the Executive Chairman \\nresponsible for developing the strategic direction of the business and ensuring the effective operation of \\nthe Board, including compliance with principles of good corporate governance, and the Chief Executive \\nprimarily responsible for implementing strategy and running the Group’s operations on a day to day \\nbasis. As appropriate, and in order to ensure good corporate governance, the Executive Chairman \\nis assisted by the Company’s independent non-executive Deputy Chairman in ensuring the effective \\noperation of the Board. \\nThe division of responsibilities between the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive has been set out in \\nwriting and agreed by the Board in accordance with the Code (provision A.2.1).\\nSUPPLY OF INFORMATION\\nInformation is supplied to the Board in a timely manner with board papers and accounts being provided in \\nadvance of meetings. When the Board requests additional information it is provided.\\nRE-ELECTION\\nThe Company’s Articles stipulate that one third of all directors are required to retire by rotation at each \\nAnnual General Meeting and all newly appointed directors are required to offer themselves for election by \\nthe shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting. \\nHowever, the Code requires that all directors of FTSE 350 companies be subject to annual re-election by \\nshareholders. Therefore all the directors will be submitted for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General \\nMeeting in July. Acknowledging the Code requirement for a particularly rigorous review in circumstances \\nwhere non-executive directors’ terms are being extended beyond six years, the Board has determined that \\nall directors continue to make a valuable contribution to the commercial success of the Company, with each \\nbringing a complementary range of skills to the team.   Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 40\\nREMUNERATION COMMITTEE\\nThe Board has a Remuneration Committee whose responsibility is to ensure that the remuneration \\nof executive directors is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate people of the highest calibre. The \\nRemuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, namely Julian Schild \\n(Chairman of the Committee), Melvin Lawson and Michael Pavia. The Directors’ Remuneration Report, \\ngiving the details of the emoluments of each director, may be found on pages 48 to 67.\\nThe Remuneration Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Company’s website  \\n(www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk), which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it by \\nthe Board.\\nAUDIT COMMITTEE\\nThe Audit Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, Michael Pavia (Chairman of the \\nCommittee), Melvin Lawson and Julian Schild in compliance with the Code (provision C.3.1). The activities \\nof the Audit Committee are set out on pages 44 to 47.\\nThe Audit Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Company’s website  \\n(www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk), which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it by \\nthe Board.\\nEXTERNAL AUDITOR \\nThe Audit Committee is mindful of the Code’s requirement for FTSE 350 companies to put external audit \\ncontracts out to tender at least every ten years. In March 2013 the Company’s then auditor PKF (UK) LLP \\n(“PKF”), which had been in place for over ten years, completed its merger with fellow accountancy firm \\nBDO LLP (“BDO”). During PKF’s tenure, and in accordance with ethical procedures, audit partners rotated \\nevery five years. The prior year represented the fifth and final year for the Company’s then audit partner \\nand the Committee would ordinarily have proposed that the external audit contract for the current year \\nbe put out to tender.\\nHowever, the Committee concluded that the merger of PKF and BDO increased the breadth of resources \\navailable to the Company for the conduct of the audit. The audit for the current year was led by a partner \\nfrom the BDO side of the merger and therefore in practice the Committee felt that the audit was conducted \\nby a new audit firm with few pre-conceptions and a fresh perspective, and as such this marks the first year \\nof a fresh ten year cycle. \\nNonetheless, and whilst the Committee is satisfied with the performance of BDO, it is conscious of the \\nprinciples behind the requirement in the Code to tender the external audit and will therefore continue to \\nclosely monitor the performance, objectivity and independence of BDO. Should any concerns arise in these \\nareas then it is likely the Committee will reconsider its position in relation to tendering the audit contract \\nwithin the current ten year period as set out in the Code. \\nNOMINATION COMMITTEE\\nThe Nomination Committee comprises Michael Pavia (Chairman of Committee), Julian Schild and Charles \\nWigoder and therefore has a majority of independent non-executive directors in compliance with the Code \\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT\\nCONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 41\\n(provision B.2.1). The main purpose of the Nomination Committee is to make recommendations to the \\nBoard on the appointment of new directors.\\nThe Nomination Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Company’s website  \\n(www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk), which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it \\nby the Board. \\nThe activities of the Nomination Committee are set out on page 43.\\nRELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS\\nIt is the policy of the Company to maintain a dialogue with institutional shareholders and to keep them \\ninformed about the objectives of the business. The Board considers that it is appropriate for the executive \\ndirectors to discuss any relevant matters regarding company performance with major shareholders and this \\nis undertaken primarily by the Chief Executive and Finance Director. The Chief Executive provides feedback \\nfrom major shareholders to the other directors, in order to ensure that Board members, and in particular \\nnon-executive directors, develop a balanced understanding of the views of major investors. The executive \\ndirectors met with a number of the Company’s main shareholders during the year.\\nThe Executive Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director also have periodic discussions with the \\nCompany’s brokers and issues are fed back to the Board as appropriate. When reports are received \\nfrom the Company’s brokers following investor presentations, these are submitted to the Board for \\nreview. Additionally the non-executive directors have at least one opportunity each year to meet with the \\nCompany’s brokers to discuss any issues.\\nResponsibility for communication with key shareholders in relation to corporate governance and Board \\nremuneration matters lies primarily with the Deputy Chairman who is assisted in this regard by the \\nCompany Secretary. Individual invitations to engage with the Deputy Chairman were sent out to key \\nshareholders during the year and, where requested, matters were discussed in more detail.\\nANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\\nNotice of the Annual General Meeting and related papers are sent to all shareholders at least 20 working \\ndays before the meeting. Separate resolutions are proposed for each matter including the adoption of the \\nReport and Accounts, the approval of the Company’s Remuneration Policy, the Directors’ Remuneration \\nReport and the appointment of the Group’s external auditor. Proxy votes are counted and the meeting \\nis advised of the number of proxies lodged for and against each resolution. The Chairmen of the Audit, \\nRemuneration and Nomination Committees and the remaining non-executive directors are available to \\nanswer questions. Shareholders who attend are invited to ask questions and take part in the meeting.\\nINTERNAL CONTROL\\nThe Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management. \\nHowever it recognises that any system can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against \\nmaterial misstatement or loss.  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 42\\nIn conjunction with the Company’s senior management team, the executive directors regularly identify, \\nreview and evaluate the key risks faced by the Group and the effectiveness of the internal controls in \\nplace to mitigate these risks. The results of these reviews are recorded in a formal document which sets \\nout a detailed evaluation of each risk and the associated internal control in place to mitigate that risk. The \\ndocument is reported to the Audit Committee and the Company’s external auditor for review at least once \\nper year.\\nThe Board of directors has continued to review the internal controls of the Company (including financial, \\noperational and compliance controls and risk management) and the principal risks which the Company \\nfaces during the year. No material weaknesses in internal controls were identified during the year. The \\nprincipal risks faced by the Company and the measures taken to address these risks are set out in the \\nStrategic Report on pages 24 to 28.\\nThe disclosures regarding internal controls do not encompass the Company’s investment in the associate \\nOpus Energy Group Limited.\\nSHARE CAPITAL AND VOTING RIGHTS\\nDetails of the Company’s share capital and substantial shareholdings can be found in the Directors’ Report \\nunder the capital structure and substantial shareholders sections on pages 69 and 70.\\nBy Order of the Board\\nDavid Baxter\\nCompany Secretary\\n20 May 2014\\n \\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT\\nCONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 43\\nNOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT \\nThe Nomination Committee comprises Michael Pavia (Chairman of the Committee), Julian Schild and \\nCharles Wigoder and therefore has a majority of independent non-executive directors in compliance with \\nthe UK Corporate Governance Code (provision B.2.1).\\nThe key responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include:\\n•  making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of new non-executive and executive directors, \\nincluding making recommendations as to the composition of the Board generally and the balance \\nbetween executive and non-executive directors;\\n•  giving consideration to succession planning for directors and other senior executives;\\n•  reviewing on an annual basis the time required from non-executive directors and assessing whether the \\nnon-executive directors are spending enough time to fulfil their duties;\\n•  reviewing the re-election by shareholders of directors under the annual re-election provisions of the Code; \\nand\\n•  evaluating any matters relating to the continuation in office of any director including the suspension or \\ntermination of service of an executive director.\\nAlthough no new directors were appointed to the Board during the year, other Committee matters \\nwere periodically discussed as part of full Board meetings. These discussions principally concerned the \\nappropriateness of the composition of the Board in the light of the Company’s existing operations and \\nmedium-term strategic objectives, and succession planning for directors and senior management. \\nNo changes to the Board were deemed necessary during the year although consistent with the \\nrequirement of the Code to ensure a progressive refreshing of the Board, the Committee has been tasked \\nwith developing a firm plan for independent non-executive director succession over the coming year, to \\nreflect the long service of both Michael Pavia and Melvin Lawson since their appointment to the Board in \\nlate 2006. \\nThe Committee’s position in relation to diversity and the Code requirement to specify measurable objectives \\nin this regard is set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 39 of this document.\\nMichael Pavia\\nChairman of the Nomination Committee\\nOn behalf of the Board\\n20 May 2014 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 44\\nAUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe Audit Committee (“the Committee”) comprises three independent non-executive directors, Michael \\nPavia (Chairman of the Committee), Julian Schild and Melvin Lawson in accordance with the UK Corporate \\nGovernance Code (the “Code”) (provision C.3.1). Michael Pavia is also identified as having recent and \\nrelevant financial experience. \\nTHE AUDIT COMMITTEE\\nAttendance at Committee meetings during the current year by Committee members is set out in the \\nCorporate Governance Report on page 37 of this document. In accordance with best practice, the \\nCommittee has the opportunity, as required, to meet with the external auditor of the Company without the \\npresence of any executive directors and has done so during the current year. \\nThe key responsibilities of the Committee include:\\n•  reviewing the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditor and the direction of the \\nexternal auditor to investigate any matters of particular concern;\\n•  assessing the effectiveness of the Company’s external auditor, including considering the scope and results \\nof the annual audit; \\n•  reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external auditor and assessing any potential impact on \\nobjectivity resulting from the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor;\\n•  monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and any formal announcements \\nrelating to the Company’s performance; and\\n•  reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls and other internal control and risk management \\nprocesses.\\nThe senior management team and executive directors periodically review the effectiveness of key internal \\ncontrol and risk management processes within the Company and report any changes in such activities to \\nthe Audit Committee and the external auditor for consideration. The review covers all material controls, \\nincluding financial, operational and compliance controls. \\nTHE COMMITTEE’S ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2014\\nDuring the year the Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Company’s half year and annual financial \\nstatements. The Committee advised the Board that the annual report and accounts taken as a whole provided \\na fair, balanced and understandable picture of the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 45\\nThe Committee’s review of the financial statements included a detailed evaluation of the significant \\naccounting issues therein. The actions taken by the Committee in regard to these are described in the \\ntable below. \\nISSUE ACTION TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE\\nOperational accuracy of billing system Review of external auditor procedures which included \\nComputer Assisted Audit Techniques (“CAATs”).\\nMonitoring of regulator communications (Ofgem, BABT) \\nand monthly monitoring of detailed call centre statistics \\nwhich would indicate significant billing issues.\\nValuation and recoverability of trade receivables Review of key assumptions underlying the recoverability \\nof trade receivables based on historical experience.\\nRevenue recognition and recoverability of unbilled  \\nenergy revenues\\nReview of key assumptions underlying the recoverability \\nof unbilled energy revenues based on industry reports \\nand historical experience.\\nAccounting treatment for new energy supply  \\narrangements\\nReview of key aspects of new energy supply \\narrangements to determine the most appropriate \\naccounting treatment including whether the acquired \\nentities fall within the scope of IFRS 3 Business \\nCombinations.\\nRisk of management override of internal controls Review of significant accounting estimates and \\njudgements in relation mainly to receivables balances.\\nAlso, in conjunction with the Company’s external auditor, the Audit Committee has considered, amongst \\nother matters, compliance with the provisions of the Code and accounting developments, the Company’s \\nfinancial control environment and its risk management and control processes. As part of this process the \\nAudit Committee has also considered the need for any special projects or internal investigations and \\nconcluded that no such projects or investigations have been required. \\nIn accordance with the Code (provision C.3.5), the Audit Committee has also considered the need for \\nan internal audit function at the Company and has concluded that, in the light of its review of the internal \\ncontrols in place and the report of the external auditor, no such function is currently required.  \\nEXTERNAL AUDITOR EFFECTIVENESS\\nThe external auditor presents a detailed audit report to the Audit Committee following a review of the \\nannual financial statements. Having regard to its review of the work performed by the external auditor \\nduring the year and its approach to key audit issues, the Audit Committee remained satisfied with the \\neffectiveness of the external auditor.  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 46\\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Committee reviewed:\\n•  the experience and expertise of the audit team;\\n•  the scope and eventual fulfilment of the detailed audit strategy;\\n•  the robustness and perceptiveness of the audit team in their handling of key accounting and audit \\njudgements; and\\n•  the nature and quality of the content of the external auditor’s report.\\nThe Committee has therefore recommended to the Board, for approval by shareholders at the AGM, the \\nreappointment of BDO LLP (“BDO”) as the Company’s external auditor for the coming year. \\nThe Committee’s position in relation to BDO’s tenure and the audit tendering requirements of the Code are \\nset out in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 40.\\nEXTERNAL AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE \\nIn order to guard against the objectivity and independence of the external auditor being compromised, the \\nprovision of any significant additional services aside from audit and tax compliance remains subject to the \\nprior approval of the Audit Committee. The Committee would normally be likely to prohibit the provision of \\nthe following types of non-audit related work by the Company’s external auditor:\\n•  book-keeping and work relating to the preparation of accounting records and financial statements that \\nwill ultimately be subject to external audit;\\n•  financial information system design and implementation; \\n•  appraisal or valuation services in respect of material assets;\\n•  internal auditing;\\n•  investment advice or corporate broking; and\\n•  any other work where mutual interests exist that could compromise the independence of the  \\nexternal auditor.\\nDuring the year the Audit Committee pre-approved the provision of reporting accountant services to the \\nCompany by the external auditor relating to the new energy supply arrangements with Npower which \\nincluded the acquisition of Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited from Npower \\nLimited (“the Engagement”). The Committee reviewed the services to be provided under the terms of \\nthe Engagement and concluded that in the light of the nature of the work proposed, and the level of the \\nassociated fees (as set out in note 2 of the financial statements on page 90 of this document), the external \\nauditor’s objectivity and independence would not be compromised. \\nFurthermore the Committee concluded that the external auditor was best placed to provide the services \\ngiven the tight timetable for the Engagement and the external auditor’s inherent understanding of the \\nCompany’s existing energy supply arrangements with Npower which were integral to the transaction. \\nAUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT\\nCONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 47\\nThe Committee’s conclusion in relation to the external auditor’s objectivity and independence was based on \\nthe following key points against the background of the APB’s Ethical Standards: (i) the external auditor would \\nnot be undertaking any decisions on behalf of management, providing investment advice or acting as an \\nadvocate for the Company as a result of the Engagement; (ii) the fee for the Engagement was not contingent, \\nwas priced on a consistent basis to other similar projects and was not material to either the external auditor \\nor the Company; (iii) the subject matter relating to the Engagement would not be incorporated into the \\nCompany’s financial statements and therefore no self-review threat existed; (iv) the Engagement was to be \\ncompleted well before the commencement of the audit for the year ended 31 March 2014 and therefore \\ncould not conceivably unduly influence the conduct of the audit; and (v) the Engagement would not pose a \\nthreat to independence through increased familiarity of audit personnel with the Company as the main aspects \\nof the Engagement were to be carried out by a completely separate department within the external auditor’s \\norganisation.\\nREPORTING OF STAFF CONCERNS\\nThe Chairman of the Audit Committee, Michael Pavia, is the primary point of contact for staff of the \\nCompany to raise, in confidence, concerns they may have over possible improprieties, financial or \\notherwise. All employees have been notified of this arrangement on the Company’s intranet website \\nwhich sets out Michael Pavia’s contact details (Code provision C.3.4). No such matters were raised by \\nemployees during the current year.\\nMichael Pavia\\nChairman of the Audit Committee\\nOn behalf of the Board\\n20 May 2014\\n  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 48\\nDIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT\\nANNUAL STATEMENT\\nDear Shareholder,\\nI am delighted to have the opportunity to provide an introduction to the Remuneration Committee report \\nwhich appears on pages 49 to 67.\\nTelecom Plus has had a successful year’s trading (as detailed elsewhere in the Annual Report) and the new \\nenergy supply arrangements with Npower are a testament to the vision, enterprise and dedication of the \\nexecutive team.\\nThe Company’s remuneration policy is set in full on pages 49 to 57. We are totally aware that we operate \\nwithin a competitive environment and aim to reward senior executives fairly - but not excessively. We would \\nnot expect total remuneration to fall within the upper quartile relative to comparable organisations over the \\nlong term. \\nAt present, executive directors are not paid bonuses in either cash or shares. The Committee’s view is that \\nfull alignment of interest between executives and shareholders is achieved through the grant of market price \\nshare incentives at periodic intervals. Thus, unless the share price increases the executive director receives \\nnothing beyond his basic salary and fringe benefits.\\nAs part of our remit, we have reviewed the performance of the Chief Executive and Finance Director. We \\nfelt it appropriate to increase Andrew Lindsay’s base salary by 8.3% particularly in view of the greater \\nrange of responsibilities undertaken by him during the year. Chris Houghton’s salary was judged to be \\nbelow current market rates; he received an increase of 33.3% and a further award of share options. The \\nCommittee has acknowledged investor feedback and raised the performance conditions thresholds required \\nfor these options to vest.\\nAndrew Lindsay played an outstanding role in the successful negotiation of the new energy supply \\narrangements with Npower. Over the next few years he will be leading the team to ensure that Telecom \\nPlus, its shareholders and customers derive maximum benefit from the exciting opportunities it brings. We \\nanticipate granting further market value options to Andrew Lindsay later this year vesting over three, five \\nand seven years reflecting the contribution that we expect him to make towards the achievement of the \\nCompany’s objectives.\\nFinally, I should like to thank our shareholders for their support and constructive engagement over the  \\npast year.\\nJulian Schild\\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee\\n20 May 2014\\n  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 49\\nREMUNERATION POLICY\\nREMUNERATION COMMITTEE\\nThe Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations \\nto the Board regarding the policy relating to the total remuneration paid to the executive directors and \\nmembers of senior management of the Company. It meets regularly to review and set all elements of the \\nremuneration paid to the executive directors of the Company, including pension rights, and monitors the \\nlevel and structure of remuneration for other senior management of the Company. It also exercises all the \\npowers of the Board in relation to the operation of the Company’s share incentive schemes, including the \\ngrant of options and the terms of those grants.\\nThe Committee met formally four times during the year and details of attendance at this meeting are \\nprovided in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 37.\\nThe Committee’s principal activities during the year included:\\n• Reviewing and approving executive remuneration packages;\\n• Monitoring senior management remuneration packages;\\n•  Reviewing and approving the issue of share options to the Finance Director, certain employees and \\nindependent distributors of the Company; and\\n• Determining the performance conditions attached to the issue of share options.\\nREMUNERATION POLICY INTRODUCTION\\nThe Company’s overall remuneration policy remains to ensure that the executive directors and other senior \\nmanagers are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their individual contribution to the overall long term \\nperformance of the Company, in a manner that ensures that the Company is able to attract, motivate, and \\nretain executives of the quality necessary to ensure the successful management of the Company. \\nThe Company’s current remuneration policy is based on the principle that the fortunes of the directors \\nand senior management should be directly aligned with those of external shareholders, and this is \\npredominantly achieved through the use of share incentive plans. The Remuneration Committee currently \\nbelieves that share incentive awards granted at market value provide a far more transparent method by \\nwhich to directly align each director’s interests with all shareholders when compared to the payment of \\nregular annual cash bonuses based on short-term performance measures and/or the granting of ‘free’ \\nshares with little or no downside risk to the participant.\\nThe outstanding awards made under share incentive schemes to date are broadly consistent with the future \\npolicy set out below and, for the avoidance of doubt, will remain in place until exercise.\\nThe future remuneration policy described in this part of the report has been prepared in accordance with \\nthe requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium–sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and \\nReports) Regulations 2008 (as amended in August 2013), and is intended to apply for the three years \\nbeginning on the date of the forthcoming AGM, subject to shareholder approval at the meeting.

Adjusted EPS \\nis considered appropriate as a key strategic objective of the Company is to drive profitable growth in each \\nyear. It also provides a balance to relative TSR, which considers shareholder value creation and reflects \\nmarket expectations of future performance, and absolute service number growth which, when achieved \\nresponsibly, will also drive long-term value creation. \\nThe use of relative TSR and Adjusted EPS growth measures provides a combined focus on the Company’s \\nfinancial performance and shareholder value creation. Targets for Adjusted EPS are set by reference to \\ninternal budgeting plans and external market expectations. TSR targets are set on a standard practice, median \\nto upper quartile ranking range. Only 30% of share incentive awards vest for threshold levels of performance.\\nThe Committee wishes to retain the ability to change the composition of performance conditions for future \\ngrants to directors should this be required in order to appropriately reflect the strategic responsibilities of \\nthe particular director concerned.\\nILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY\\nThe bar chart below seeks to illustrate the potential rewards available under the proposed remuneration \\npolicy for the coming financial year under varying levels of performance. For the purposes of the illustration \\nthe values assume the maximum grant of share incentive awards during the year and no annual cash \\nbonuses are paid. However, as outlined in the above table, the Remuneration Committee reserves the \\nright to bring or carry forward any unused annual share incentive scheme allowances. Therefore, share \\nincentives might not be awarded during a particular year, and/or share incentive awards may be larger \\nthan 200% of base salary in any one year. \\nThe amounts included for share incentive awards are based on one third of the market value of the shares \\nunder option. The amounts for pensions and benefits included in the fixed remuneration figure have been \\ncalculated on the same basis as payments made for the year ended 31 March 2014.\\nThe potential rewards available for ‘on–target’ performance under share incentive schemes have been \\nbased on 30% vesting of share incentive awards.

In determining these amounts the Committee will be mindful of, inter alia, \\nprevailing market rates, the chosen candidate’s skills, knowledge and experience, and their existing location \\nand position.\\nWhere the candidate has variable remuneration arrangements with a previous employer that will be lost \\non leaving employment, the Company will consider offering a sign-on award in compensation for the \\nvalue foregone, either as an award under an existing share incentive scheme or a bespoke award under \\nthe Listing Rules exemption available for this purpose. The face and/or expected values of the award(s) \\noffered will not materially exceed the value ascribed to the award(s) foregone, and would normally follow \\nthe same vesting timing and form (i.e. cash or shares) save that the Committee may award the whole of \\nthe value in shares, at its discretion. The application of performance conditions would be considered and, \\nwhere appropriate, the awards could be made subject to claw-back in certain circumstances.

For the avoidance of doubt, should a new director be \\ninternally promoted from the Company’s senior management team they will not be expected to give up \\nor amend any element of remuneration granted to them prior to becoming a director which is inconsistent \\nwith the remuneration policy set out above.\\nAny new executive director’s remuneration package would include the same elements, and be subject to \\nthe same constraints, as those of the existing executive directors as outlined in the above policy table.\\nREMUNERATION POLICY\\nCONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 57\\nNON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS FEES POLICY\\nHow component supports \\nstrategic objectives\\nOperation of component Maximum potential value \\nof component\\nPerformance metrics  \\nused, weighting and time \\nperiods\\nTo attract non-executive \\ndirectors who have a \\nbroad range of experience \\nand skills to support and \\noversee the implementation \\nof strategy and ensure \\ngood corporate \\ngovernance.\\nNon-executive directors’ \\nfees are set by the Board \\nas a whole and aligned \\nwith the responsibilities of \\neach director.\\nAnnual fees are paid in 12 \\nequal monthly instalments \\nduring the year.\\nNon-executive directors’ \\nfees are periodically \\nreviewed by the Board in \\nthe light of any changes in \\nrole and prevailing market \\nrates for non-executive \\ndirectors in similarly sized \\nlisted companies.\\nNon-executive directors’ \\nremuneration will not be set \\noutside the parameters of \\nprevailing market rates for \\nsimilarly-sized companies \\nof equal complexity.\\nNon-executive directors are \\nnot eligible to participate \\nin any performance-related \\narrangements or share \\nincentive schemes.\\nSTATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS\\nThe Chairman of the Committee engages with certain of the Company’s largest shareholders who have \\nexpressed an interest in being consulted in relation to remuneration matters to understand their expectations \\nand monitor any changes in their views. This year, major shareholders who had previously indicated an \\ninterest in being consulted were contacted in relation to the setting of performance conditions for share \\nincentive scheme awards. As a result of previous feedback received, and as described in the Remuneration \\nCommittee report for this year below, the Committee decided to reduce the threshold vesting level for share \\noptions and increase the level of challenge in the performance conditions set.\\nSTATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP\\nThe Committee considers pay levels across the organisation when setting remuneration for all directors \\n(both executives and non-executives). However this review is undertaken against a background of ensuring \\nthat the prevailing market rates for all levels of employee in the organisation are taken into account in order \\nto attract, retain and motivate the best employees at each level. In relation to directors, specific account \\nis taken of any change in the level of responsibility of the director (whether through a change in role or \\nthe increased size of the Company) or an increase in experience and knowledge of the Company and its \\nmarkets which may not be relevant to roles elsewhere in the Company. \\nThe Company does not deem it appropriate to formally consult with employees regarding the determination \\nof the directors’ remuneration policy as the broad remuneration structure for directors mirrors that of all \\nemployees, i.e. the payment of a base salary, benefits and share incentive scheme awards at market price. \\nHowever, employees have the opportunity to make comments on any aspect of the Company’s activities \\nthrough an employee survey and any comments made which are relevant to directors’ remuneration would \\nbe considered by the Committee. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 58\\nANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION\\nThis report, which has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance \\nCode (“the Code”) issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012 and Schedule 8 of the \\nLarge and Medium–Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended \\nin August 2013) (“the Regulations”), has been approved by the Board of directors for submission to \\nshareholders for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The sections under the headings \\n“Single Total Figure of Remuneration”, parts of “Share Incentive Schemes” and “Pension Schemes” have \\nbeen subject to external audit.\\nSINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION\\nThe Committee recommended increases to the annual base salaries of each of the executive directors \\nduring the year. Mr Wigoder received an increase of 2.8% to £370,000 and Mr Lindsay an increase \\nof 8.3% to £390,000. Mr Houghton received a larger percentage increase of approximately 33.3% to \\n£300,000 in recognition of the increasing responsibility and complexity inherent in his role, his growing \\nexperience of the Company and its markets, and to reflect the fact that his previous salary was considerably \\nbelow the market rate for Finance Directors of FTSE 250 companies of a similar size. However, given the \\nrecent increases made to his salary over the past two years, Mr Houghton is not expected to receive routine \\nsalary increases of this magnitude in future.\\nIn addition, share options with performance conditions attached were issued to Mr Houghton during the \\nyear, details of which are set out below in this report.\\nThe non-executive directors receive fees for their services, the details of which are described below. The \\nlevel of these fees was unchanged during the year. \\nYEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2014 (AUDITED)\\nAudited details of directors’ remuneration for the year are as follows: \\nDIRECTOR\\nSALARY & FEES\\nTAXABLE \\n BENEFITS\\nPENSION  \\nCONTRIBUTIONS\\nSHARE  \\nINCENTIVES TOTAL\\n£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000\\nCharles Wigoder 370 5 37 - 412\\nJulian Schild 35 - - - 35\\nAndrew Lindsay 390 3 39 - 432\\nChris Houghton 300 6 30 - 336\\nMelvin Lawson 12 - - - 12\\nMichael Pavia 21 - - - 21\\nTOTAL 1,128 14 106 - 1,248\\nThe amounts relating to benefits received relate principally to the provision of private health insurance and \\nCompany motor vehicles to the directors.

The first share \\noption plan and the JSOP are available to employees, and the second share option plan is available to the \\nCompany’s independent distributors.\\nThe Employee Share Option Plan\\nSubject to serving the requisite probationary period, all employees are eligible to participate in the \\nCompany’s employee share option plan and be issued with market price options over shares in the \\nCompany, the number of shares being related to their seniority and length of service.\\nThe Committee recognises that the collective contribution of all employees is critical to the success of the \\nCompany and continues to believe that the granting of share options at all levels within the organisation \\ngenerates employee loyalty and helps to ensure that staff turnover is kept to a minimum and below the \\nlevels seen across the industry for employees passing their probationary periods.\\nThe Joint Share Ownership Plan\\nAwards made through the JSOP provide participants with a joint interest in tranches of shares which are \\nheld until vesting by an independent employee benefit trust (the “JSOP Share Trust”). The trustee of the JSOP \\nShare Trust is Barclays Wealth Trustees (Guernsey) Limited. The value to participants of awards made under \\nthe JSOP is based upon the growth in the value of the Company’s shares from the date of grant in a similar \\nmanner to the value achieved through participation in the conventional share option scheme. However, \\nparticipants in the JSOP only receive value to the extent that the share price increase exceeds a compound \\nannual growth rate of at least five per cent (the “Hurdle Rate”). On vesting, participants receive any gain  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 60\\nHurdle Rate being retained by the JSOP Share Trust. In addition, awards made under the JSOP to executive \\ndirectors will only vest to the extent applicable performance conditions relating to the financial and trading \\nperformance of the Company are met. It is currently considered unlikely by the Committee that further \\nawards will be made under the JSOP.\\nThe Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan\\nThe Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives and rewards to those \\ndistributors who have been most successful in gathering new customers for the Company. These distributors, \\nwhilst not being employees of the Company, are nevertheless essential to its future growth, and it is the \\nopinion of the Committee that this plan can in some cases be an important factor in their motivation. \\nDuring the year options were issued in two tranches to 218 distributors under a share option promotion \\nscheme which requires the participants to achieve performance conditions in order for the options to vest. \\nThese performance conditions will involve distributors consistently gathering customers throughout the three-\\nyear vesting periods of the options.\\nStatement of Directors’ Shareholding and Share Interests (audited)\\nDetails of the directors’ shareholdings are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 68. As set out in the \\nFuture Remuneration Policy Table above, a target level of share ownership is not stipulated for directors, \\nhowever, subject to personal circumstances and existing shareholdings they are encouraged to retain a \\nproportion of shares issued as a result of the exercise of share incentive awards.\\nDetails of the share awards held by or granted to directors during the year are set out in the tables below \\n(further details on the estimated cost of these awards are set out in note 18 to the financial statements):\\nANDREW LINDSAY\\n1 APRIL \\n2013 GRANTED EXERCISED\\n31 MARCH \\n2014\\nEXERCISE \\nPRICE\\nEXERCISABLE \\nFROM\\nEXPIRY\\nDATE\\nShare options\\n12 Jun 2008 217,400 - 217,400 - 330.5p 12 Jun 11 11 Jun 18 \\nJSOP interest (shares held jointly with the JSOP Share Trust)\\n31 March 2011 500,000 - - 500,000 N/A 1 Apr 15 N/A\\nCHRIS HOUGHTON\\n1 APRIL \\n2013 GRANTED EXERCISED\\n31 MARCH \\n2014\\nEXERCISE \\nPRICE\\nEXERCISABLE \\nFROM\\nEXPIRY\\nDATE\\nShare options\\n10 Dec 2008 50,000 - - 50,000 340p 10 Dec 11 9 Dec 18\\n26 June 2009 50,000 - - 50,000 278p 26 Jun 12 25 Jun 19\\n26 June 2012 25,000 - - 25,000 828p 26 Jun 15 25 Jun 22\\n26 June 2012 25,000 - - 25,000 828p 26 Jun 17 25 Jun 22\\n16 Dec 2013 - 25,000 - 25,000 1739p 16 Dec 16 15 Dec 23\\n16 Dec 2013 - 25,000 - 25,000 1739p 16 Dec 18 15 Dec 23\\nANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION\\nCONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 61\\nThe share options granted to Andrew Lindsay on 12 June 2008 were fully exercised on 26 February 2014. \\nIn accordance with the rules of the Employee Share Option Plan, the Company elected to satisfy these \\noptions by transferring 179,115 shares to Mr Lindsay at nominal value, representing the value of the gain \\nmade on these options at the market price for Ordinary Shares on the day of exercise. \\nFollowing the exercise of these options, Mr Lindsay sold 179,115 Ordinary Shares on 26 February 2014 \\nfor an average price of 1,853.34 pence per Ordinary Share. Following the sale of these shares Mr Lindsay \\nretained an interest in 132,312 Ordinary Shares, excluding his joint interest in the award made under the \\nJSOP detailed below.\\nThe award of a joint interest in 500,000 shares made to Mr Lindsay on 31 March 2011 under the JSOP \\n(“the JSOP Share Award”) was made subject to performance conditions which were described in detail \\nin the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2011. The interest Mr Lindsay holds in the JSOP Share \\nAward allows him, subject to the achievement of the performance conditions summarised below, to receive \\nany increase in the value of the 500,000 shares over the share price on the date of grant (£4.55) plus an \\nannual compound growth rate of five per cent. This means that if Mr Lindsay were to exercise his award on \\nthe first date of vesting, 1 April 2015, he would receive any value over £5.53 per share. \\nThe table below sets out the compound annual growth rates required during the vesting period across \\nthe three performance conditions which will determine the percentage of the 500,000 shares that will be \\nused to calculate the total gain attributable to Mr Lindsay, e.g. if the Company were to achieve compound \\nannual EPS and TSR growth of exactly 5% over the vesting period the gain attributable to Mr Lindsay would \\nbe calculated based on the total value of 250,000 shares over the annual compound 5% Hurdle Rate. The \\nnumber of shares used to calculate the gain which Mr Lindsay will be entitled to receive on vesting will \\ndepend on the average growth achieved across the two highest performance conditions. \\nPERCENTAGE OF  \\n500,000 SHARES\\nEPS GROWTH TSR GROWTH\\n1\\nSERVICE NUMBER \\nGROWTH \\n100% 7.5% 7.5% 7.5%\\n50% 5.0% 5.0% 5.0%\\n50%-100%\\n2\\n5.0%-7.5% 5.0%-7.5% 5.0%-7.5%\\nNIL <5% <5% <5%\\n1\\n compound annual share price growth assuming 22p annual dividend\\n2\\n percentage of shares to be calculated on a straight line basis\\nThe 50,000 options granted to Mr Houghton on 10 December 2008 were granted to him prior to his \\nappointment to the Board on terms that performance conditions would not be imposed in respect of this \\ngrant.

However, \\nit should be noted that as market price options their value to Mr Houghton rests solely on the increase in \\nthe Company’s share price from the point of grant. In accordance with guidance in the FRC’s Lab Project \\nReport: Reporting of pay and performance issued in March 2013, the value of market price share options \\ncan be measured as one third of the market value of the shares under option. The total value of these \\noptions granted to Mr Houghton under this measure would therefore represent approximately 96% of his \\nannual base salary for the year.\\nThese options were made subject to performance conditions as described in detail below. In determining \\nthe nature of these performance conditions, the Committee was mindful of views expressed by investors \\nin relation to performance conditions previously used by the Company for share incentive awards. The \\nCommittee therefore decided to reduce the percentage level for threshold vesting to 30% and use a \\nweighted average across the three performance conditions rather than allowing the flexibility of using the \\nhighest two of three measures.   \\nANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION\\nCONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 63\\nThe extent to which these options will vest will depend on the average growth, weighted equally in this \\ninstance, achieved across the three annual performance measures summarised in the table below:\\nPERCENTAGE OF  \\nOPTIONS VESTING\\nADJUSTED \\nEPS GROWTH\\nRELATIVE \\nTSR GROWTH\\n1\\nSERVICE NUMBER \\nGROWTH \\n100% CPI + 12.5% Upper quartile 20.0%\\n30% CPI + 5.0% Median 10.0%\\n30%-100%\\n2\\nCPI + 5.0%-12.5% Median – Upper quartile 10.0%-20.0%\\nNil <CPI + 5.0% Below median <10.0%\\n1\\n Company TSR performance relative to the FTSE 350 (excluding Investment Trusts)\\n2\\n Percentage of shares to be calculated on a straight line basis\\nThe base year for the Adjusted EPS performance measure will be the Adjusted EPS for the year ended \\n31 March 2013, but re-based to reflect the impact of the revised terms of the new energy supply \\nagreement agreed with Npower in December 2013, as set out in the prospectus issued by the Company \\nto shareholders on 20 November 2013. The prospectus confirmed that, had the revised energy supply \\nagreement been in place during the whole year ended 31 March 2013 the incremental pre-tax profit would \\nhave been £9.3 million. This amount has therefore been used to re-base the Adjusted EPS for the year \\nended 31 March 2013.\\nAt the year end the Company’s share price was 1,793p and the range during the financial year was \\n1,035p to 1,914p.

As noted in previous years, the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index \\nwas initially selected at a time when a larger proportion of the Company’s revenues related to the supply \\nof telephony services; only approximately 12.5% of the Company’s revenues are now generated from such \\ntelephony services. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 64\\nThe FTSE 350 Index is included as a further comparator in the light of the fact that there are no sector \\nspecific indices containing directly comparable quoted companies supplying a broad range of services \\nsimilar to that provided by the Company. \\nTABLE OF HISTORICAL DATA\\nThe following table shows the total remuneration, as defined by the Regulations, and the amount vesting \\nunder share incentive schemes as a percentage of the maximum that could have been achieved, in respect \\nof the Chief Executive.

The size of the increase \\nawarded to Mr Lindsay reflected the increased responsibility inherent in his role specifically as the size of \\nthe Company grew during the period. The increase also reflected the relative level of his salary compared \\nto chief executives of other similarly-sized publicly listed companies. At other levels within the Company \\nincreases of a comparable size to Mr Lindsay’s were made where appropriate to similarly reflect increases \\nin responsibility for certain individuals.\\nRELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPEND ON PAY\\nThe Regulations require an illustration of the significance of the Company’s expenditure on pay in the \\ncontext of its operations.

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 66\\nExecutive Chairman Charles Wigoder’s annual base salary was increased from £370,000 to £420,000. \\nThis increase primarily reflects the fact that the Company will no longer be making pension contributions on \\nbehalf of Mr Wigoder as he has reached the limit of the lifetime allowance for pension contributions under \\ncurrent HMRC rules. The contributions made by the Company to Mr Wigoder’s pension during the year \\nended 31 March 2014 amounted to £37,000, representing the majority of the salary increase for 2015, \\nwith the balance of the increase broadly reflecting inflation.\\nThe annual base salary of Chief Executive Andrew Lindsay was increased from £390,000 to £455,000 \\nreflecting his strong personal performance and the incremental responsibility resulting from the significant \\nincrease in the size and profile of the Company during the year following the entering into of the new \\nenergy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013.\\nThe annual base salary of Finance Director Chris Houghton was held at £300,000 reflecting the large \\nincrease made to his salary last year.\\nShare Incentive Schemes\\nIt is expected that a share option award will be made to Chief Executive Andrew Lindsay during the coming \\nyear. The award will comprise the granting of market value options over 300,000 shares which will vest in \\nthree discrete equal tranches after three, five and seven years. The award will fall within the limits set out \\nin the Remuneration Policy above as Mr Lindsay has not received a share incentive scheme award since \\n2011. The Committee will be mindful of the size of this award when considering any future awards to Mr \\nLindsay in future.\\nThe performance measures to be applied to Mr Lindsay’s award will mirror those used for the award of \\noptions to Finance Director Chris Houghton in December 2013 as summarised below. It is expected that \\neach performance measure will be given an equal weighting. The base year for measuring performance \\nwill be the year ended 31 March 2014.\\nPERCENTAGE OF  \\nOPTIONS VESTING\\nADJUSTED \\nEPS GROWTH\\nRELATIVE \\nTSR GROWTH\\n1\\nSERVICE NUMBER \\nGROWTH \\n100% CPI + 12.5% Upper quartile 20.0%\\n30% CPI + 5.0% Median 10.0%\\n30%-100%\\n2\\nCPI + 5.0%-12.5% Median – Upper quartile 10.0%-20.0%\\nNil <CPI + 5.0% Below median <10.0%\\n1\\n Company TSR performance relative to the FTSE 350 (excluding Investment Trusts)\\n2\\n Percentage of shares to be calculated on a straight line basis\\nFull details of the proposed award will be set out in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2015.\\nANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION\\nCONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 67\\nOther benefits\\nRemuneration in relation to pension contributions and other benefits for the year will be made in accordance \\nwith the Remuneration Policy set out above.\\nSHAREHOLDER VOTE AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\\nAs set out in the Remuneration Policy Statement above, the Committee encourages dialogue with the \\nCompany’s major shareholders regarding remuneration matters and will endeavour to consult with these \\nshareholders ahead of any significant future changes to the remuneration policy.\\nDetails of the votes cast in relation to the remuneration report at last year’s AGM are set out below:\\n2013 AGM NUMBER %\\nVotes cast in favour 38,623,684 90.08\\nVotes cast against 4,259,816 9.92\\nTotal 42,883,500 100.00\\nIn addition to the above there were 1,977,181 votes withheld.\\nJulian Schild\\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee\\nOn behalf of the Board\\n20 May 2014 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 68\\nDIRECTORS’ REPORT\\nThe directors have pleasure in presenting their report and the audited financial statements for the year to 31 \\nMarch 2014.\\nPRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS REVIEW\\nA full review of the development of the business is contained in the Strategic Report on pages 3 to 33.

In such cases, where the identified shares make up 0.25% or more of the ordinary shares in issue, \\nthe directors may refuse to register a transfer of any of the identified shares in certificated form and, so far \\nas permitted by the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, a transfer of any of the identified shares \\nwhich are held in the electronic share dealing system CREST, unless the directors are satisfied that they  \\nhave been sold outright to an independent third party.\\nOther than as set out below and so far as the directors are aware, there were no arrangements at 31 \\nMarch 2014 by which, with the Company’s co-operation, financial rights carried by securities are held \\nby a person other than a holder of securities, or any arrangements between holders of securities that are \\nknown to the Company and which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.\\nExecutive Chairman Charles Wigoder entered into an agreement to charge 325,000 of his shares in the \\nCompany as security for a loan from Barclays Bank on 3 December 2013. The loan enabled him to apply \\nfor 57,142 ordinary shares as part of his open offer entitlement which resulted from funding the Company’s \\nentering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower on 20 December 2013. Under the terms \\nof the charge, title to the 325,000 shares can be transferred, sold or otherwise dealt with by Barclays \\nfollowing the occurrence of a failure to pay any amount due and payable under the loan. \\nIn addition, certain members of senior management have loans secured against some or all of their \\nshareholdings in the Company which restrict their ability to transfer these shares prior to repayment of  \\nthe loans.\\nThe Company established a Joint Share Ownership Plan (“the JSOP”) on 30 March 2011. As part of the \\nJSOP an employee benefit trust was established to jointly hold shares with the participants in the plan (“the \\nJSOP Share Trust”).

In normalising profit before tax we added back the \\nannual share incentive scheme charges which are impacted by movements in the Group’s share price and \\nthe amortisation charge in respect of intangible assets. We consider this measure to be the most significant \\ndeterminant of the Group’s financial performance and therefore an appropriate basis for materiality as it is \\none of the key performance indicators used by management.\\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all audit differences individually \\nin excess of £50,000. We also agreed to report differences below these thresholds that, in our view, \\nwarranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\\nThe audit work undertaken in relation to the significant components was executed at levels of materiality \\napplicable to each entity and ranged from £1.5m to £1.65m.\\nOverview of the scope of our audit\\nA description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the FRC’s website at  \\nwww.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.\\nIn establishing our group audit approach we gained an understanding of the Group and the regulatory \\nenvironment in which it operates and we subsequently focused on the three principal trading companies \\nwhich account for 85% of the Group’s profit before tax. Additional audit procedures were performed on \\nfinancial information from those components not considered to be significant to provide us with reasonable \\nassurance that material error does not exist within those components.

We \\nhave discussed our assessment of the risks of material misstatement with the Audit Committee who have set \\nout on pages 44 to 47 of their report consideration of these risks.\\nAREA OF RISK HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE RISK\\nACCURACY OF THE BILLING SYSTEM\\nThe billing system is central to the Group’s business and \\nis responsible for generating several key balances which \\nare reported in the Group financial statements.\\nWe focused on this area as it is possible that any \\nsystematic errors in the billing system could result in \\nprocessing errors causing material misstatement across \\nmultiple balances within the financial statements.  \\nThe documentation and testing of the Group’s IT system, \\nprocesses and controls is a core part of our audit scope \\nand addresses the potential risks arising from the billing \\nsystem with enhanced procedures being performed in \\nrelation to revenues and commissions payable.\\nWe assessed and tested the key controls that surround the \\nbilling system as well as the integrity of the data being \\ngenerated through the inclusion of Information System \\nspecialists on the audit team and through the application \\nof Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (“CAATs”). \\nVALUATION AND RECOVERABILITY OF TRADE RECEIVABLES\\nThe reported trade receivables balance is largely \\nrepresented by customers who have debt assigned to \\ntheir prepayment meter or have defaulted on a payment. \\nAs a result, recoverability of uncollected debt requires \\nmanagement to make significant judgements regarding \\nexpected future receipts from customers.\\nWe evaluated the ageing analysis and composition of \\ntrade receivables and challenged the appropriateness \\nof management’s key assumptions used in the provision \\ncalculations.\\nOur work involved reviewing assumptions applied in \\nthe context of the Group’s historical experience and \\nperforming sensitivity analysis on the critical assumptions \\nto determine the extent of change in those assumptions  \\nthat would be required for the provision to change \\nmaterially.  \\nREVENUE RECOGNITION AND THE VALUATION AND RECOVERABILITY OF UNBILLED ENERGY SUPPLIED\\nEstimation is required in relation to revenue as a material \\nelement of unbilled energy supplied is measured by \\nmultiplying usage by an average rate per KwH. \\nMoreover, whilst the Group makes every effort to \\nmeasure customers’ energy usage through accurate meter \\nreading and estimation, income is accrued in relation to \\nenergy supplied which is yet to be allocated to individual \\ncustomer accounts. A degree of estimation is required in \\ndetermining this accrued revenue.\\nIn addition management have made certain valuation \\nprovisions against the receivable which requires \\nestimation judgement.\\nWe considered the rationale for recognising revenue \\nbased on energy supplied but not yet billed, and \\nevaluated the processes and procedures surrounding \\ncustomer meter reading. \\nSpecifically, we considered evidence that supports the \\npropensity of customers to under-report energy usage, \\nand usage levels which have not been independently \\nverified.\\nOur work also involved reviewing the rationale and \\nassumptions applied in identifying irrecoverable usage \\nand the estimates and significant judgements adopted \\nin determining recoverable amounts, identifying and \\nchallenging those assumptions that have the greatest \\nimpact on the receivable. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 76\\nAREA OF RISK HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE RISK\\nACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF NEW ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS\\nAs disclosed in notes 6 and 21 to the financial \\nstatements, during the year the Group acquired two \\nentities in order to enter into a wholesale supply and \\nservices agreement with Npower. The directors do not \\nconsider that these acquisitions represented business \\ncombinations under IFRS 3 Business Combinations (“IFRS \\n3”) and accordingly have treated the transaction as the \\npurchase of assets under the framework set out in IAS 38 \\nIntangible Assets.\\nIn determining the appropriate accounting treatment \\nand disclosures required in the financial statements it \\nwas necessary for the directors to exercise judgement in \\napplying IFRS to the circumstances of the transaction.\\nWe reviewed the sale and purchase and wholesale \\nsupply and services agreements and have challenged \\nmanagement’s assessment that the acquired entities did not \\nmeet the definition of businesses under IFRS 3. \\nWe considered the factors outlined in note 21 and, in \\nparticular, the relationship between the company, Npower \\nand the acquired entities both before and after the \\ntransaction date. \\nRISK OF MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF INTERNAL CONTROLS\\nThe financial statements include a number of balances \\nincluding current receivables which require the directors \\nto make estimates and exercise judgement in determining \\nrecoverable amounts. \\nWe examined the significant accounting estimates \\nand judgements relevant to the financial statements for \\nevidence of bias by the directors.\\nIn particular, we tested key reconciliations, unbilled \\nrevenue, provisions surrounding delinquent customers, \\nintangible asset amortisation and fair values.\\nWe also tested manual journal entries.\\n \\nOPINION ON MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006\\nIn our opinion:\\n•  the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance \\nwith the Companies Act 2006;\\n•  the information given in the strategic report and directors’ report for the financial year for which the \\nfinancial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\\n•  the information given in the corporate governance statement set out on pages 36 to 42 of the annual \\nreport with respect to internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting \\nprocesses and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.\\nOTHER MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION\\nAdequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received\\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\\n• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\\n•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our \\naudit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\\n• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.\\nWe have nothing to report in respect of these matters.\\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF TELECOM PLUS PLC\\nCONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 77\\nDirectors’ remuneration\\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of \\ndirectors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited \\nis not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these \\nmatters or our review.\\nCorporate governance statement\\nUnder the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the corporate governance statement \\nrelating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We \\nhave nothing to report arising from our review.\\nGoing concern\\nAs required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 71 that the group is a \\ngoing concern. We have nothing to report arising from our review.\\nOur duty to read other information in the annual report\\nUnder International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our \\nopinion, information in the annual report is:\\n•  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or\\n•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group \\nacquired in the course of performing our audit; or\\n•  is otherwise misleading.\\nIn particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between the \\nknowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is \\nfair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that \\nwe communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We have not \\nidentified any such inconsistencies, apparent misstatements or misleading statements.\\nRESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR\\nAs explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, on page 72, the directors are \\nresponsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and \\nfair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance \\nwith applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us \\nto comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.\\nThis report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 \\nof the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s \\nmembers those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.

The consolidated \\nfinancial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2014 comprise the Company and its \\nsubsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) and the Group’s interest in associates. \\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 20 May 2014. \\nPRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nAs a result of the increasing relative size of the cash-settled share incentive scheme charges it has been \\ndecided to separately disclose the amount on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive \\nIncome for the period. The increase in this charge mainly reflects the strong rise in the Company’s share \\nprice over the last year and therefore separate disclosure was deemed appropriate in order to provide a \\nclearer understanding of the underlying performance of the business. \\nIn view of the size and nature of the charge as a non-cash item, it has also been decided to separately disclose \\nthe amortisation of intangible assets on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for \\nthe period. More information regarding the intangible asset is set out in note 6 of these financial statements.\\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\n(a) Statement of compliance \\nThe financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with \\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations \\nCommittee (“IFRIC”) interpretations as endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 \\napplicable to companies reporting under IFRS. \\n(b) Basis of preparation \\nThe accounts are prepared on a going concern basis. \\nCritical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions\\nIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described below, the Directors have \\nmade judgements, estimations and assumptions regarding the future. The judgements, estimations, and \\nassumptions that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are \\ndetailed below.\\nEstimates and judgements are evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including \\nexpectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In future, actual \\nresults may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\\n(i) Trade receivables (notes 10 and 11)\\nTrade receivables largely represent customers who have energy debt assigned to a prepayment meter,  \\nor are in the process of having such a meter installed. This requires the Directors to make estimates  \\nand judgements as to the expected level of eventual debt recovery from these customers based on \\nhistorical experience. \\n(ii) Revenue recognition and unbilled energy debtors (note 11)\\nAccrued revenue includes balances for energy consumption which have yet to be allocated and billed \\non to individual customers. In the absence of meter readings, the level of this revenue relies on industry \\nestimates of annual consumption by the Group’s customers. The Directors are required to make estimates \\nand judgements as to the likelihood of this revenue being billed and recovered based on industry \\ninformation and historical experience.\\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 84\\n(iii) Share incentive scheme charges (note 18)\\nThe Group has a conventional share option scheme and a Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”) for \\nemployees and Directors. The fair value of share options and JSOP awards is estimated by using the \\nBinomial valuation model on the date of grant based on certain assumptions. Those assumptions are \\ndescribed in note 18 and include, amongst others, the dividend yield, expected volatility, expected life of \\nthe options and number of options expected to vest. \\n(iv) New energy supply arrangements (note 21)\\nThe entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013 included \\nthe acquisition of two new subsidiaries from Npower. The Directors were therefore required to make a \\njudgment in relation to the accounting treatment of the transaction under IFRS 3 Business Combinations. \\nFurther detail regarding the transaction and the associated accounting treatment are set out in note 21 \\nof these financial statements.\\nBy virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from presenting a statement of \\ncomprehensive income. The Company made a profit for the year of £18,811,000 (2013: £25,600,000).\\nThe following standards and interpretations have become mandatory for the Company during the \\ncurrent accounting period, but where relevant to the Company they have not had a material impact on \\nthe financial statements:\\n• IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements;\\n• IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures;\\n• IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure;\\n• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements;\\n• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements; \\n• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities; and\\n• IFRS 13 Fair Value measurement.\\n(c) Basis of consolidation\\n(i) Subsidiaries \\nThe Group’s financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Telecom Plus PLC and its subsidiaries. \\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group and are included until \\nthe date on which the Group ceases to control them. Control is recognised where an investor is expected \\nto receive, or has rights to, variable returns from its investment in the investee and has the ability to affect \\nthese returns through its power over the investee. Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on \\nconsolidation.\\n(ii) Associates\\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary \\nnor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and \\noperating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\\nThe results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the \\nequity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the \\nconsolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of \\nthe net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an \\nassociate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate are not recognised.\\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 85\\n(d) Business combinations\\nThe acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for in accordance with the guidance set out in IFRS 3 Business \\nCombinations (“IFRS 3”). An analysis of whether any subsidiaries acquired constitute businesses in their \\nown right is initially undertaken with reference to the guidance in IFRS 3. \\nWhere an acquired subsidiary does not constitute a business under IFRS 3 (i.e. it does not have, inter alia, \\nthe inputs, processes and outputs to function on a standalone basis) the acquisition of the subsidiary is \\ntreated as an acquisition of assets. The assets acquired are recorded at cost and no goodwill is recognised. \\nTransaction costs are capitalised as part of the cost of acquisition.\\nWhere an acquired subsidiary constitutes a business under IFRS 3, the assets, liabilities and contingent \\nliabilities of the subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost \\nof acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is \\nreviewed for impairment at least annually and any impairment is recognised immediately in the Statement \\nof Comprehensive Income. \\n(e) Revenue\\nRevenue is the value of goods and services supplied to external customers and independent distributors \\nexcluding value added tax and other sales related taxes. For each of the Company’s main income streams \\nfrom the provision of fixed line telephony, broadband, mobile telephony, gas and electricity services, \\ntransactions are recorded as sales in the month when the provision of those services or the supply of goods \\ntakes place. The Company’s customers are invoiced in the month following that in which the services \\nare provided. The Company also generates revenue as a result of providing bill payment protection and \\naccidental death cover to customers for a monthly fee. The Company does not retain the insurance risk \\nfor these services. The recognition of revenue associated with the provision of gas and electricity services \\nto customers by the Group relies on industry estimates of annual usage where meter readings are not \\navailable. These estimates are based on historical usage information as adjusted for known factors such as \\nvariations in weather.\\n(f) Interest income\\nInterest income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues, using the effective \\ninterest rate method.\\n(g) Leases\\nPayments on operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line \\nbasis over the lease term.\\n(h) Hire purchase agreements\\nHire purchase agreements relate to leases of assets where the Group has passed on substantially all the \\nrisks and rewards of ownership and are therefore classified as finance leases. When assets are leased out \\nunder finance leases, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable.\\n(i) Taxation\\nThe tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in the Statement of \\nComprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which \\ncase it is recognised in equity.\\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the \\nbalance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 86\\nDeferred tax is recognised, based on the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences between \\nthe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for \\ntaxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or \\nsettlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted \\nat the balance sheet date.\\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be \\navailable against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no \\nlonger probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\\n(j) Property, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less a provision for depreciation. Depreciation is calculated \\nso as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets in equal instalments over their expected \\nuseful lives. No depreciation is provided on freehold land. Depreciation is provided on other assets at the \\nfollowing rates:\\nFreehold buildings 50 years\\nPlant and machinery 15 years\\nFixtures and fittings 7 years\\nFreehold and leasehold improvements 3 years\\nComputer and office equipment 3 to 5 years\\nMotor vehicles 4 years\\nThe carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when there is an \\nindication that they may be impaired.\\n(k) Intangible assets\\nIntangible assets which arise (e.g. on the entering into of significant commercial contractual arrangements) \\nare capitalised and amortised over their useful life, or the term of any contractual arrangement or, where \\nappropriate and an indefinite life is chosen, made subject to an annual impairment review.\\n(l) Goodwill\\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the difference between the cost of acquisition \\nand the fair value of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised and is subject to impairment review, both \\nannually and when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. \\n(m) Impairment\\nThe carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at \\neach balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication \\nexists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their \\nfair value less costs to sell and value in use.\\nAn impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit \\nexceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\\nAn impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the \\nrecoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does \\nnot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment \\nloss had been recognised.\\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 87\\n(n) Investments\\nIn the Company’s accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are initially stated \\nat cost. Provision is made for any impairment in the value of these investments. In the Group accounts \\ninvestments in associated undertakings are shown at cost plus accumulated profits less any dividends \\nreceived from the associated undertakings.\\n(o) Inventories\\nInventories principally include mobile telephones and other electronic equipment and are valued at the \\nlower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is measured on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value \\nrepresents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in \\nmarketing, selling and distribution.\\n(p) Financial instruments\\nThe Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial \\nasset, a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual \\narrangement.\\nFinancial instruments are recognised on the trade date when the Group becomes a party to the contractual \\nprovisions of the instrument. Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of a \\nfinancial instrument not at fair value through profit and loss, transactions costs that are directly attributable \\nto the acquisition or issue of the financial instrument.\\nFinancial instruments are derecognised on the trade date when the Group is no longer a party to the \\ncontractual provisions of the instrument.\\n(q) Trade receivables\\nTrade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated \\nirrecoverable amounts. The interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the \\nshort credit period is not considered to be material.\\n(r) Cash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits with banks and, for the purposes of the \\nCash Flow Statement, revolving credit facilities.\\n(s) Borrowings\\nShort and long term borrowings comprise revolving credit facilities and bank loans. The fees associated \\nwith entering into borrowing facilities are capitalised and netted off against borrowings and amortised over \\nthe term of the borrowings.\\n(t) Trade payables\\nTrade payables are stated at their nominal value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting \\nfuture cash payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material.\\n(u) Share based payments\\nThe fair value at the date of grant of share based remuneration, principally share options, is calculated \\nusing a binomial pricing model and is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight \\nline basis over the vesting period of the award. The charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income \\ntakes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest. All share option based remuneration is equity \\nsettled, except as set out below. \\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 88\\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) \\nThe Company established a Joint Share Ownership Plan (the “JSOP”) on 30 March 2011. On vesting, any \\ngains made on awards granted under the JSOP may be settled either through: (i) a cash payment to the \\nparticipant equal to the gain; or (ii) the transfer of legal and beneficial ownership to the participant of such \\nnumber of shares as have full value equal to the gain. \\nJSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a \\nbinomial pricing model. The fair value is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight \\nline basis over the vesting period of the award. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, \\nand at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value \\nrecognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. \\n(v) Segmental reporting\\nFinancial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the \\nchief operating decision maker, Chief Executive Mr Andrew Lindsay, is disclosed in note 1 to the accounts.\\n(w) Provisions\\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is \\nprobable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ \\nbest estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are \\ndiscounted to present value where the effect is material.\\n(x) Pensions\\nThe Group makes contributions to certain employees’ personal pension plans. These are charged to the \\nStatement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they become payable.\\n(y) Dividends\\nFinal dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s \\nfinancial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. \\nInterim dividends are recognised when paid.\\n(z) New standards issued but not yet effective\\nThe Group has not adopted any standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation \\ndates. It is not expected that adoption of the majority of standards or interpretations which have been \\nissued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the EU, but have not been \\nadopted, will have a material impact on the financial statements.

However, the Company entered \\ninto a new energy supply agreement with Npower with effect from 1 December 2013. As the new supply \\nagreement is in substance considered to be an extension of the supply agreement entered into in May \\n2011, the opening intangible asset will be recognised on the Company’s balance sheet within the cost of \\ninvestments in subsidiary undertakings (see note 8) and continue to be recognised as an intangible asset on \\nthe Group’s balance sheet.

Furthermore, depending on the circumstances giving rise to a termination event, \\nthe additional consideration (if payable) may be spread over the unexpired term of the supply agreement. \\nFollowing any such termination event, the Group would have direct access to the wholesale energy markets \\nand the opportunity to earn additional margin from sourcing energy directly for the Group’s customer base.\\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements\\nTelecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 107\\n18.

Under the terms of the JSOP 500,000 shares were \\nissued to an Employee Benefit Trust (“the JSOP Share Trust”) administered by Barclays Wealth (Guernsey) \\nLimited, which holds the shares jointly with the only current participant, Mr Lindsay. The JSOP Share Trust \\nwas provided with an interest free loan from the Company to subscribe for the 500,000 shares, and \\ntherefore the transaction was cash flow neutral for the Company. \\nAs set out in note (u) of the Significant Accounting Policies, JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled \\nand therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a binomial pricing model. The fair value liability is \\ncharged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the \\naward. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value \\nof the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the amortisation charge in the \\nStatement of Comprehensive Income. \\nThe following key assumptions were used to determine the fair value liability of the JSOP award of \\n1,207.9p per share as at 31 March 2014: a strike price of 553p per share, a share price of 1,793p as \\nat 31 March 2014, expected volatility of 39.6%, an expected remaining life of 1 year, a risk free rate of \\n0.43% and an expected dividend yield of 1.95%. \\nA reconciliation of movements in the numbers of share options for the Group can be summarised as follows:\\n2014 2013\\nNumber Weighted \\naverage  \\nexercise price\\nNumber Weighted \\naverage  \\nexercise price\\nAt 1 April 2,243,787 514p 2,014,652 356p\\nOptions granted 765,950 1,507p 1,030,800 790p\\nOptions exercised (653,888) 310p (417,850) 242p\\nOptions lapsed/expired (434,700) 1,060p (383,815) 718p\\nAt 31 March 1,921,149 855p 2,243,787 514p\\nThe weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised during the year was \\n1,612.9p (2013: 882.5p).\\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 108\\n18.

DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\nTreasury activities take place under procedures and policies approved and monitored by the Board. They \\nare designed to minimise the financial risks faced by the Group which primarily arise from credit, interest \\nrate and liquidity risks.\\nCarrying amounts of financial instruments\\nAll financial assets, which include cash, trade and other receivables and accrued income, are classified as \\nloans and receivables with a total value for the Group of £213,536,000 (2013: £144,567,000) and for \\nthe Company of £63,811,000 (2013: £146,331,000). All financial liabilities, which include trade and \\nother payables and accrued expenditure, are held at amortised cost with a total value for the Group of \\n£251,858,000 (2013: £105,316,000) and for the Company £132,350,000 (2013: £108,193,000).\\nCredit risk \\nAll customers are invoiced monthly and approximately 90% pay by direct debit; accordingly credit risk \\nin respect of trade receivables is considered low due to the large number of customers supplied, each of \\nwhom represents an insignificant proportion of total revenue. \\nThe Company has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers. \\nThis means that although the Company is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from a potential new \\ncustomer who is not considered creditworthy, the Company is obliged to supply domestic energy to anyone \\nwho submits a properly completed application form. Where such customers subsequently fail to pay for \\nthe energy they have used (“delinquent customers”), there is likely to be a delay before the Company \\nis able to eliminate its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter \\nor disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such delinquent customers from \\nincreasing their indebtedness are not always fully recoverable. \\nThe maximum credit risk for the Group is £213,536,000 (2013: £144,567,000) and for the Company \\n£63,811,000 (2013: £146,331,000).\\nInterest rate risk \\nThe Group finances its day to day operations primarily through cash generated within the business. Cash \\nsurpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank PLC at money market rates to maximise returns. \\nThe Group’s profit and equity for the current year will not be significantly affected by changes in the UK \\nbase rate of +/- 1% from current levels despite the recent increase in the level of net borrowings resulting \\nfrom the transaction with Npower in December 2013. \\nCommodity price risk\\nThe Group is not exposed to any fluctuations in commodity prices due to the nature of the agreements \\nwith wholesale providers of telephony and energy services and its ability to pass the effect of any such \\nfluctuations through to its customers.\\nLiquidity risk\\nThe Group’s treasury management policies are designed to ensure continuity of funding. \\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 112\\n19. DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)\\nForeign currency risk\\nThe Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.\\nInterest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities\\nAll financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling. Receivables due after one year include \\n£4,242,000 (2013: £3,215,000) due from employees and distributors which earns interest at variable \\nrates above Base Rate.\\nBorrowing facilities \\nAt 31 March 2014, the Group had total working capital facilities of £25,000,000 (2013: £20,000,000). \\nThese facilities are available to the Group until 20 December 2016.

RELATED PARTIES (CONTINUED)\\nDuring the year, the Company acquired goods and services worth approximately £16,000 (2013: \\n£17,000) from companies in which directors have a beneficial interest. No amounts were owed to these \\ncompanies by the Company as at 31 March 2014. During the year, the Company sold goods and services \\nworth approximately £10,000 (2013: £Nil) to companies in which directors have a beneficial interest. \\nDuring the year directors purchased goods and services on behalf of the Company worth approximately \\n£1,841,000 (2013: £736,000). The directors were fully reimbursed for the purchases and no amounts \\nwere owing to the directors by the Company as at 31 March 2014.\\nAs disclosed in the circular sent to shareholders on 20 November 2013, certain directors participated in a \\nfirm placing of new ordinary shares in the Company as follows: Mr Andrew Lindsay: £750,000, Mr Julian \\nSchild: £240,000 and Mr Michael Pavia: £10,000.\\nOther related party transactions\\nAssociates \\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2014, the associate supplied goods to the Group which amounted to \\n£903,000 (2013: £877,000) and at 31 March 2014 the associate was owed £72,000 by the Group \\nwhich is recognised within trade payables (2013: £66,000). Transactions with the associate are priced \\non an arm’s length basis. Dividends received during the year from the associate amounted to £3,056,000 \\n(2013: £2,365,000) relating to the financial year to 31 March 2013. \\nSubsidiary companies \\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2014, the Company’s subsidiaries purchased goods and services from \\nthe Company in the amount of £9,350,000 (2013: £5,816,000). At 31 March 2014 the Company was \\nowed £226,000 by the subsidiaries which is recognised within trade receivables (2013: £3,558,000 \\nowed by the Company to the subsidiary).\\n21. NEW ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS AND ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS\\nThe Company entered into new energy supply arrangements with Npower through the acquisition of \\nElectricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited (“the Companies”) from Npower Limited on 20 \\nDecember 2013 (“the Transaction”). The Transaction had economic effect from 1 December 2013. \\nThe accounting treatment for the Transaction was considered against the guidance set out in IFRS 3 Business \\nCombinations (“IFRS 3”).\\nIt was determined that the acquisition of the Companies did not represent business combinations under \\nIFRS 3 as both Companies did not have the three key elements of a standalone business as set out in IFRS 3 \\n(i.e. inputs, processes and outputs). The principal factors behind this determination were as follows: (i) the \\nCompanies were originally set up solely as legal vehicles to facilitate the supply of energy to Telecom Plus \\ncustomers by Npower; (ii) all customer relationships were acquired, held and managed by Telecom Plus; \\n(iii) the Companies did not have any influence over the terms on which energy was supplied to them; (iv) \\nthe Companies were not able to influence who their customers were and had no pricing discretion for the \\nonward supply of energy; (v) the Companies did not have any infrastructure, management or employees \\nwith all functions being carried out by either Telecom Plus or Npower; and (vi) given the unique nature of \\nthe Companies and the associated energy supply agreement between Telecom Plus and Npower, it was not \\nconsidered feasible that another market participant could effectively acquire and operate the Companies on \\na standalone basis.\\nAs a result of these factors the acquisition of the Companies has been accounted for as an acquisition of \\nassets rather than as business combinations. \\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 114\\n21.  NEW ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS AND ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS \\n(CONTINUED)\\nThe total consideration for the Transaction comprised a cash payment to Npower of £196.5 million on \\n20 December 2014, a deferred cash amount of £21.5 million payable on 20 December 2016 and a \\ncash payment of £2.5 million made in January 2014 for the net assets acquired in the Companies which \\ncomprised cash and short term working capital balances. \\nSummary balance sheets for the Companies as at 30 November 2013, adjusted for the payment of \\npre-disposal permitted dividends to Npower Limited on 11 December 2013 (Gas Plus Supply Limited: \\n£1,378,000 and Electricity Plus Supply Limited: £1,876,000), are set out below:\\nGas Plus Supply Limited\\nAs at 30 November 2013 \\n£’000\\nCurrent assets\\nAccrued revenues 32,372\\nCash 31,136\\nTotal assets 63,508\\nCurrent liabilities\\nAccruals and other creditors (62,352)\\nTotal liabilities (63,352)\\nNet assets 1,156\\nElectricity Plus Supply Limited\\nAs at 30 November 2013 \\n£’000\\nCurrent assets\\nAccrued revenues 23,455\\nPrepayments and other debtors 15,849\\nCash 33,039\\nTotal assets 72,343\\nCurrent liabilities\\nTrade creditors (8,506)\\nAccruals and other creditors (62,459)\\nTotal liabilities (70,965)\\nNet assets 1,378\\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  COMPANY NUMBER\\n3263464\\nREGISTERED OFFICE\\nNetwork HQ,\\n333 Edgware Road,\\nLondon NW9 6TD\\nSECRETARY\\nDavid Baxter ACA\\nSTOCKBROKERS\\nPeel Hunt Ltd\\nMoor House\\n120 London Wall,\\nLondon EC2Y 5ET\\nSOLICITORS\\nNabarro LLP\\nLacon House,\\nTheobald’s Road,\\nLondon WC1X 8RW\\nAUDITORS\\nBDO LLP\\n55 Baker Street,\\nLondon W1U 7EU\\nBANKERS\\nBarclays Bank PLC\\n1 Churchill Place,\\nLondon E14 5HP\\nREGISTRARS\\nCapita Asset Services\\nThe Registry,\\n34 Beckenham Road,\\nBeckenham, \\nKent BR3 4TU REPORT AND ACCOUNTS \\nYEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2014\\nTELELCOM PLUS PLC, NETWORK HQ , 333 EDGWARE ROAD, LONDON NW9 6TD \\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS   YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2014\\nHOME PHONE BROADBAND MOBILE GAS ELECTRICITY HOME PHONE BROADBAND MOBILE GAS ELECTRICITY\\n',\n",

The\\nCompany has achieved exceptional results\\nonce again and we are continuing to\\nbuild a good reputation, particularly in\\nand around East London. \\nWe are making a significant contribution\\nto the regeneration of the area\\nsurrounding Docklands and the City.\\nWith average selling prices below\\n£250,000 and the increasing attraction\\nof living close to major employment\\nareas, demand for our product continues\\nto be strong.\\nRelationships with public sector housing\\nproviders are crucial to our business and\\nwe have continued to develop these during\\nthe year. We firmly believe that these\\nrelationships will prove very successful,\\nboth for our partners and for Telford\\nHomes, in the future and we place great\\nvalue on them.  \\nAt the end of the financial year our\\nbusiness employed 48 people, more\\nthan double the number at our previous\\nyear end. This increase includes the\\nstrengthening of our management\\nteam, both at board level and senior\\nmanagement, as well as the appointment\\nof staff throughout the business. I would\\nlike to take this opportunity to thank\\neach and every one of our employees for\\ntheir contribution to the Company this\\nyear. Our success is clear evidence of\\ntheir efforts.  \\nWe have a number of exciting new\\ndevelopments to build and sell in 2003\\nand 2004 which will contribute to another\\nyear of growth for the Company.\\nDavid Holland\\nChairman\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2003\\n“The Company has achieved\\nexceptional results once again and\\nwe are continuing to build a good\\nreputation, particularly in and\\naround East London.” 3\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2003\\nLittle Docklands Chelmsford 4\\nChief Executive’s review\\nAndrew Wiseman Chief Executive Financial results\\nI am delighted to report a substantial\\nperformance, generating profit before\\ntax of £4.3 million, in our second period\\nof trading. Since incorporation in\\nDecember 2000, the growth of Telford\\nHomes has been tremendous and\\nreflects the efforts of everybody who is\\ninvolved with the Company. \\nTurnover for the year ended 31st March\\n2003 was £25.3 million compared with\\n£8.8 million in our first 16 month period\\nof trading to 31st March 2002. Earnings\\nper share for the year were 12.7p\\n(2002 – 10.1p) and the directors are\\nproposing a final dividend of 2.0p per\\nshare making 3.0p for the year.  \\nOver the course of the year we exchanged\\ncontracts on the sale of 112 “open-market”\\nprivate homes at an average selling price\\nof £214,000. In our first 16 month\\ntrading period we exchanged contracts\\non 61 “open-market” homes at an\\naverage price of £210,000.\\nIncreasingly our business involves building\\nmixed developments. During the year\\nour income was complemented by the\\nsale of 11 “affordable” homes, six small\\nretail units, 6,500 square feet of office\\nspace, a construction contract to build a\\ncommunity centre and the sale of a\\nsmall development site. Including those\\nsales, we exchanged contracts on 132 \\nproperties in the year. Our target for the \\nfull year, set out in the Interim Statement\\nannounced on 19th November 2002, was\\nto exchange contracts on 137 properties.\\nHowever, the mix of sales in the year and\\nour progress on development sites\\nwas such that our performance in\\nreported turnover and profit before\\ntax is in excess of our expectations at\\nthat time.\\nOur product and the market place\\nWe remain focused on a small\\ngeographical area to the east of the City\\nof London and the area in and around\\nDocklands. In addition we have one\\ndevelopment in Chelmsford town centre.\\nWe continue to appraise land purchase\\nopportunities in these as well as wider\\nareas and we may consider opportunities\\nthat will broaden our geographical\\nspread, but still be within one hour’s\\ntravel from our offices.\\nOur product is typically a one or two\\nbedroom apartment with a bathroom\\nfor each bedroom, a lounge/dining room,\\nan attached and fully fitted kitchen with\\nbreakfast area and a private terrace or\\nbalcony providing outside space. Floor\\ncoverings of laminated wood in the halls\\nand living rooms, carpets to the bedrooms\\nand tiling to kitchens and bathrooms are\\nprovided as standard. \\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2003\\n“Our relationships with public\\nsector housing providers continue\\nand we look forward to further\\ninvolvement with them.”\\nCase Study\\nGale Street\\nOne of several sites purchased\\nfrom Poplar HARCA, one of our\\npublic sector housing partners.\\nGale Street is part of the ongoing\\nregeneration of East London\\nincluding the creation of attractive\\nprivate developments, close to\\ngood transport links, in areas of\\npredominantly affordable housing.\\nGale Street consists of 11 private\\napartments. All 11 were sold to\\none investment buyer in July 2002\\nand the development was\\ncompleted and handed over in\\nApril 2003. 5\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2003\\nLansdowne Drive E8 Blondin Street E3\\nGale Street E3 6\\nChief Executive’s review\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2003\\nEach development would contain a\\nrange of apartment types at varying\\nprices, and would include a number with\\nexceptional features such as large terraces,\\ndouble height living rooms, duplex\\napartments or galleried mezzanine spaces.\\nThe majority of our homes have been sold\\nat an early stage of construction, usually\\n12 months prior to build completion.\\nPurchasers have generally been investment\\nbuyers who either sell-on or hold the flat\\nfor letting purposes. Despite signs of a\\nhousing market slowdown for property\\npriced above £250,000, buyers of our\\nproperties continue to be active and\\nour performance since the year end\\nsupports this statement.\\nDevelopment sites and\\ndevelopment partners\\nDuring the year we made two substantial\\nsite acquisitions and both sites benefit\\nfrom outline planning consents for\\nresidential development. \\nThe first is the site of the former Island\\nGardens DLR station which lies directly\\nopposite the new DLR station, on the\\nriver at the Greenwich foot tunnel. This\\nsite has a development capacity of more\\nthan 100 residential apartments and was\\nacquired as a joint venture with Asda\\nProperty Holdings Ltd.  \\nThe second is a redundant warehouse,\\naccessed from the A13, and bordering\\nthe Regents Canal at its entrance into the\\nLimehouse Basin.  \\nDetailed planning consents for these two\\nsites as well as for our major joint\\ndevelopment with East Thames Housing\\nAssociation, at Abbotts Wharf on the\\nLimehouse Cut, are nearing conclusion\\nafter negotiations with the local planning\\nauthority on design and the provision of\\n“affordable” housing. The length of time\\nit takes to achieve a satisfactory planning\\nconsent acts as a significant brake to the\\nsupply of new homes.

Telford Homes is now\\nwell placed to produce another year of\\nwell-managed growth as the business\\ncontinues to develop.\\nOperating results\\nTurnover has increased to £25.3 million\\ncompared with £8.8 million in the first\\n16 months of trading to 31st March\\n2002. An analysis of the sales that have\\ncontributed to this almost three-fold increase\\nis given in the Chief Executive’s review.\\nGross profit has increased to £6.9 million\\nfrom £2.5 million with a margin achieved\\nof 27.2% against 28.2% in the first period\\nof trading. This fall in the margin reflects\\na slowing in the rate of increase in selling\\nprices over the period and prices are now\\nstatic in our market.\\nOur operating margin has improved to\\n19.6% from 19.2%. Overheads have\\nincreased to £1.9 million in the year to\\n31st March 2003, a consequence of the\\ngrowth in the business and the need to\\nensure that we have the right people\\nand systems in place to manage the\\nCompany and build for our future success.\\nInterest\\nInterest paid was £0.7 million compared\\nwith £0.4 million in our first 16 months.\\nInterest rates have remained low over the\\ncourse of the year and the majority of our\\nfinance is currently at base rate plus 1.5%.\\nOur interest cover is 7.1 times and we\\nmonitor this to ensure that the Company is\\nnot exposed to significant interest risk\\narising from future rate changes.\\nOur profit before tax is £4.3 million\\nincreased from £1.3 million and this\\nexceptional result is well in excess of our\\noriginal expectation for the year.\\nThis result enables us to report a\\nsubstantial pre-tax return on average\\nequity of 40.6%, an increase on last year\\nof over six percentage points. Our return\\non average total capital has also increased\\nto 20.4% from 18.2%. \\nTaxation\\nThe effective tax charge remains\\napproximately 30%.\\nDividends\\nThe Company paid an interim dividend of\\n1.0p per share in January 2003. A final\\ndividend of a further 2.0p is now proposed\\nmaking a total for the year of 3.0p\\nagainst a final dividend last year of 1.0p.\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2003\\n“Telford Homes is now well placed to produce\\nanother year of well-managed growth as\\nthe business continues to develop.” 11\\nThis dividend is covered in excess of four\\ntimes by earnings per share. The final\\ndividend is expected to be paid on 11th\\nJuly 2003 to ordinary shareholders on the\\nregister on 20th June 2003. \\nEarnings per share\\nEarnings per share increased to 12.7p\\nfrom 10.1p. The weighted average\\nnumber of shares in issue increased from\\n9.3 million to 23.6 million. \\nThe Company carried out a successful\\nshare placing in July 2002 which raised\\n£3 million before costs and a further\\nplacing in November 2002 which raised\\n£0.5 million. Despite this the return on\\naverage equity and earnings per share\\nhave grown, demonstrating immediate\\nsuccess in investing the additional capital\\nto produce continued growth.\\nBalance sheet\\nNet assets at 31st March 2003 were\\n£13.3 million increased from £7.7 million.\\nThis increase reflects the £2.2 million of\\nretained profit for the year and the new\\nequity invested into the business.\\nOur asset base has been expanded and\\nwe now hold total assets of £38.9 million\\nincreased from £19.9 million. The vast\\nmajority of these assets are represented\\nby work in progress on many of our sites\\nand by debtors awaiting legal completion\\nof the properties we have exchanged to\\ndate. We have now finished work on six\\ndevelopments in total with a further four\\ndue to be completed in the next few weeks.\\nFinance\\nOur banks provide 70% of development\\nland and construction expenditure with\\nrepayments made as completion monies\\nare received. We continue to have\\nexcellent relationships with all of our\\nbanking partners, with our primary\\nbankers Allied Irish Bank providing\\nfinance for the majority of our sites with\\ntotal facilities of £18 million. The Royal\\nBank of Scotland is financing some of\\nour significant sites with facilities of £30\\nmillion including our joint venture\\nfacilities with Asda Property Holdings\\nLtd. Heritable Bank have also assisted us\\nin the year with their financing of the\\nland purchase at Abbotts Wharf.\\nOur combined overdraft facility now\\nstands at £1.5 million which gives us\\nsignificant short-term flexibility.

They have all been applied consistently throughout the\\nyear and the preceding period.\\nAccounting convention\\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with\\napplicable accounting standards.\\nTurnover and profit recognition\\nTurnover is recognised from the date of exchange of contracts for the sale of properties at a rate equivalent to\\nthe value of work undertaken in respect of land development. The value of turnover less deposits and completion\\nmonies received is included as amounts recoverable on contracts within debtors. All turnover is generated in\\nthe United Kingdom.\\nProfit on developments is recognised over the life of each contract in proportion to turnover only to the extent\\nthat the total eventual profit on the development can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Until there is\\nreasonable certainty over the final outcome of a development the profit is restricted to the non-refundable\\ndeposits received. Losses are provided for as soon as foreseen.\\nJoint arrangements\\nThe Company has certain contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do\\nnot create an entity carrying on a trade or business of its own. The Company includes its share of the assets,\\nliabilities, profits and cash flows in such joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of the\\narrangement and pro-rata to the Company’s interest in the arrangement, in its financial statements.\\nAt 31st March 2003 the Company held 50% of the issued share capital of Island Gardens Limited, a company\\nregistered in England and Wales, which has been incorporated to assist the Company in carrying out a joint activity.\\nDevelopment properties\\nDevelopment properties are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises costs of\\nacquisition and development, including directly attributable fees and expenses but not loan interest.\\nTangible fixed assets and depreciation\\nTangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight line\\nbasis at rates calculated to write down the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected\\nuseful life as follows:\\nFreehold premises                     - 50 years\\nShort leasehold premises           - term of lease\\nPlant and machinery                  - 2 to 3 years\\nMotor vehicles                           - 3 years 26\\nStatement of accounting policies  | 31st March 2003\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2003\\nTaxation\\nCorporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have\\nbeen enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.\\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the\\nbalance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a\\nright to pay less tax in the future have occurred. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are\\nexpected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and\\nlaws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.\\nFinance leases and hire purchase contracts\\nAssets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and depreciated over the shorter of\\ntheir expected useful lives and the lease term. The capital elements of the future lease obligations are recorded\\nas liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases\\nto produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of the capital repayments outstanding.\\nOperating leases\\nOperating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.\\nPension costs\\nContributions paid to group personal pension schemes (defined contribution), in respect of employees, are\\ncharged to the profit and loss account as incurred. 27\\nNotes to the financial statements  | 31st March 2003\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2003\\n1  Operating profit 12 months ended 16 months ended\\n31st March 2003 31st March 2002\\n£000 £000\\nOperating profit is stated after charging:\\nDepreciation                  - owned assets 63 23\\n- hire purchase assets 116 54\\nAuditors’ remuneration    - audit fees 17 8\\n- non-audit fees 3 41\\nOperating lease rentals   - property 45 32\\n- motor vehicles 10 -\\n- plant and machinery 2 6\\nNon-audit fees paid to the auditors in 2002 includes £33,000 charged to the share premium account in that year.\\n2 Directors’ remuneration\\nDetails of directors’ remuneration including other benefits and share options is given in the directors’ remuneration report on \\npages 16 and 17.\\nSix directors are accruing benefits under group personal pension arrangements (2002 - three). 28\\nNotes to the financial statements  | 31st March 2003\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2003\\n3  Staff costs 12 months ended 16 months ended\\n31st March 2003 31st March 2002\\nNumber Number\\nThe average monthly number of persons employed by the Company including \\nexecutive directors, during the period analysed by activity was as follows:\\nConstruction 15 6\\nAdministration 18 7\\n33 13\\n12 months ended 16 months ended\\n31st March 2003 31st March 2002\\n£000 £000\\nThe employment costs of all employees included above were:\\nWages and salaries 1,400 531\\nSocial security costs 156 46\\nOther pension costs - group personal pension arrangements 57 25\\n1,613 602\\nThe Company operates a group personal pension scheme for its employees.

Despite this the sales and customer\\nservice teams have been very successful in\\nworking with each customer individually to\\nsecure as many completions as possible.\\nIn the past year Telford Homes has not\\ncommitted to new land purchases beyond its\\nexisting partnerships with affordable housing\\nproviders, nor has the Group commenced\\nconstruction on several sites that are ready for\\ndevelopment. The Group is working hard to\\nsecure contracts to construct a number of its\\ndevelopments entirely for affordable housing\\nand the £57 million grant programme that\\nTelford Homes has recently agreed with the\\nHomes and Communities Agency (“HCA”) is\\nassisting the Group in ensuring that profitable\\nconstruction work can continue. Together, the\\ngrant programme and partnerships with housing\\nassociations will ensure the Group plays a role in\\ncontinuing the supply of new housing at a time\\nwhen construction of new homes has slowed to\\njust 25 per cent of government targets.\\nI am also delighted to report that the excellent\\nrelationships the Group has with each of the banks\\nfinancing Telford Homes have been critical in\\nconcluding negotiations to renew or extend\\nexisting facilities. Securing this debt finance\\nenables the Group to focus on generating\\noperational cash flows and reducing gearing\\nwhere appropriate.\\nControl of cash remains a priority over the coming\\nmonths as the Group continues to pursue legal\\ncompletions on pre-sold properties. Despite the\\nsuccess to date the Board must remain cautious\\nof an increase in the rate of failed contracts. As \\na result the Board has concluded that it is not\\nappropriate to pay any dividend in relation to \\nthe year to 31st March 2009. Telford Homes\\nremains on a sound operational and financial\\nplatform and depending on market conditions\\nthe Board hopes and expects to be able to \\nreturn to paying dividends in the near future.\\nDavid Holland\\nChairman (Non-Executive)\\n26th May 2009\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 4 Telford Homes Plc 2009 06\\nbusiness & financial review\\nMerchants’ Quarter E3\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 5 “The Board is cautiously\\noptimistic in its outlook\\nand believes Telford\\nHomes is well placed\\nto benefit from a future\\nimprovement in\\nmarket conditions”\\nAndrew Wiseman\\nChief Executive\\nIn spite of the unprecedented and difficult\\nfinancial environment for the Group’s investor\\ncustomers the number of open market property\\ncompletions achieved in the year to 31st March\\n2009 rose to 350 from 306 in the previous year. Total\\nrevenue has grown by 10 per cent to £106.7 million\\nwith profit before tax and exceptional items up 12\\nper cent to £7.3 million.\\nThe Group reported in September 2008 that new\\naccounting standards had resulted in a change\\nto its accounting policies in relation to open\\nmarket private homes with revenue and profit\\nnow recognised on legal completion. On\\naffordable homes, sold to housing associations\\nunder construction contracts, revenue and profit \\nis recognised on a percentage of completion\\nbasis. There are currently over 700 affordable\\nhomes being developed and payments will\\ncontinue to be received from the Group’s\\nhousing association partners as construction \\nof these homes progresses.\\nSales\\nThe strategy of Telford Homes has always been\\nto pre-sell open market homes at a very early\\nstage of construction whenever possible. The\\nsuccess of this strategy in the past has meant\\nthat the Group has had relatively few properties\\navailable for sale over the past twelve months.\\nMarket conditions have affected the confidence\\nof purchasers of new homes and as such the\\nmarketing of unsold homes on developments\\ndue for completion in 2010 and 2011 has been\\nheld back while construction continues. With\\nsubstantial forward sales on these projects,\\nincluding the affordable housing, the Group’s\\ndecision to continue building has been taken\\nwith a recognition that lower open market sales\\nprices may be realised in the future.\\nEfforts to secure new sales have been\\nconcentrated at the Group’s developments \\nat Queen Mary’s Gate in South Woodford and\\nNayland Court in Romford. At Queen Mary’s Gate\\nthe first phase of the development, including 184\\nopen market homes, was completed in May 2008\\nand all but one have been sold and occupied\\nwith the final property now reserved. The second\\nphase, including 93 open market homes, was\\ncompleted in November 2008 and 29 have been\\nsold to date. The third phase including 95 open\\nmarket homes will not be build complete until the\\nsecond half of 2010. Overall sales at Queen Mary’s\\nGate have been considerably slower throughout\\nthe last twelve months although eight sales have\\ncompleted in the last twelve weeks with a further\\nfour reserved and one property where contracts\\nhave been exchanged. Visitor levels are now\\nmuch higher than at the end of 2008 and this \\ngives the Board an expectation that a slow but\\nsteady rate of sales will continue to be achieved\\nthrough the rest of this year.\\n07     Telford Homes Plc 2009\\nchief executive’s review\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 6 Telford Homes Plc 2009 08\\nbusiness & financial review\\nMetro East E3\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 7 09    Telford Homes Plc 2009\\nchief executive’s review continued\\nOneStratford E15\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 8 20,000\\n0\\n30,000\\n40,000\\n50,000\\n60,000\\n70,000\\n80,000\\nMar 09\\nFeb 09\\nJan 09\\nDec 08\\nNov 08\\nOct 08\\nSep 08\\nAug 08\\nJul 08\\nJun 08\\nMay 08\\nApr 08\\nMar 08\\nFeb 08\\nJan 08\\nSeasonally adjusted monthly number of mortgage approvals for house purchases by individuals\\nSource: Bank of England\\nAt Nayland Court in Romford, Telford Homes has\\n26 build complete homes remaining for sale with\\ndemand for these being maintained by the ‘My\\nChoice Home Buy’ scheme (“MCHB”) from the\\nHCA which provides a mortgage for up to 50\\nper cent of the home with a very low deposit\\nand interest rate. The processing of MCHB\\napplications suffers from periodic delays in the\\nrelease of funds but the Group has seven homes\\ncurrently reserved on the development all using\\nthis product. Here again, recent progress means\\nthe Group would expect to sell the majority of\\nthe remaining properties during 2009.\\nTelford Homes will bring other developments\\nback to the market when conditions are right\\nand when construction on those developments\\nreaches an appropriate stage to attract buyers.\\nCompletions\\nFrom 1st October 2008 Telford Homes began \\na rolling programme where 613 open market\\nhomes sold in previous years would become\\ndue for legal completion in the period up to\\nMarch 2010. As at 31st March 2009, 220 of \\nthese properties had been legally completed.\\nThe key issues for the Group’s customers are the\\nrestriction of mortgage finance for buy-to-let\\ninvestors and the increasing caution applied by\\nvaluation surveyors with a lack of comparable\\ntransactions. Importantly the Group’s properties\\ncontinue to attract tenants for its investor\\ncustomers and this underpins their value.\\nThe general problems experienced in securing\\nmortgages are illustrated by statistics for the\\nnumber of mortgage approvals for house\\npurchases in 2008. The Bank of England\\nseasonally adjusted figures show that the number\\nof approvals per month fell rapidly from 71,000 in\\nJanuary 2008 to 27,000 in November 2008. Since\\nthen there has been some improvement in these\\nstatistics with the number of approvals reaching\\n39,000 in March 2009. This is still well below normal\\nlevels and, whilst to date the process of achieving\\nnew sales and completions has not got any easier,\\nthe Board hopes it is an indication that mortgage\\navailability will improve during the rest of 2009.\\nTelford Homes continues pro-active\\ncommunication with each purchaser to ensure\\ntheir financial arrangements are instigated at\\nthe right stage and the Group has been\\nworking with each of them to maximise the\\nchances of achieving completions. In addition\\nTelford Homes has maintained a dialogue with\\nsome of the major lenders and their valuers to\\ngive maximum comfort in the pricing of the\\nGroup’s apartments through transparency of\\ninformation and supporting evidence. The\\nBoard has reported in the past that the Telford\\nHomes approach to sales is based on net prices\\nagreed at the point of sale with no undisclosed\\ndiscounts or incentives and this has proved\\nextremely important both to customers of\\nTelford Homes and their lenders.\\nThe Group will rescind contracts on properties\\nwhere its customers are unable to complete \\nthe purchase, retaining the 10 per cent deposit\\nalready paid. Where necessary, Telford Homes\\nwill also take legal action against the defaulting\\npurchasers as a result of their failure to honour\\ncontractual obligations.\\nTelford Homes Plc 2009 10\\nbusiness & financial review\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 9 11     Telford Homes Plc 2009\\nDespite achievements to date the Group is\\nexperiencing significant delays in securing each\\ncompletion. As a result the Board has positioned\\nTelford Homes to withstand an increased number\\nof delays and failures. The total number of failures\\nin the year to March 2010 is forecast to reach\\nbetween 60 and 80 of the pre-sold homes due to\\ncomplete over that period, assuming there is no\\nimprovement in mortgage availability.\\nTelford Homes has contingency plans in place to\\ndeal with failed contracts which will mitigate the\\nimpact on cash flow. These plans include\\ntemporarily securing tenants for the properties\\nbefore reselling them into an orderly market. The\\nGroup has obtained outline terms from each of\\nits three banks to provide mortgages against a\\nportfolio of these rented properties at between\\n50 and 60 per cent of their value and in addition\\nthe Group is well advanced with contractual\\nnegotiations to secure £6 million of funding from\\nalternative sources at a 75 per cent loan to value\\nratio. This will enable the business to withstand\\nsignificantly more failures than anticipated as \\nwell as providing cash resources to further our\\npartnerships with housing associations and\\nhousing transfer organisations.\\nHCA and affordable housing\\nThe Board has taken a number of steps to\\nmaintain activity in the construction of new homes\\nthrough partnerships with housing associations and\\nthe HCA. As reported on 20th April 2009 the Group\\nhas agreed a grant programme with the HCA of\\n£57 million across four sites owned by Telford Homes\\nand three estate regeneration projects in\\npartnership with Eastend Homes. The grants will\\npart finance over 400 affordable homes over \\nthe next three years.\\nPartnerships with affordable housing providers\\nremain integral to the business and typically 35\\nper cent of any development is sold for\\naffordable housing. However in order to de-risk\\nnew projects the Group has sought to construct\\nsome developments entirely for its housing\\nassociation partners utilising HCA grant. Although\\nat a lower margin, this gives Telford Homes the\\nability to commence construction on these sites\\nwith secured cash inflows over the course of the\\ndevelopment. The Group has recently entered\\ninto a contract with Family Mosaic to construct 63\\naffordable homes across two sites in Queens\\nRoad, Southwark and a contract with Gallions\\nHousing Association to construct 53 affordable\\nhomes in St Anne’s Row, E14. The Group has also\\nagreed terms to construct 64 affordable homes\\nfor Poplar HARCA in Lanrick Road, E14.\\nchief executive’s review continued\\nSoBow E3\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 10 Telford Homes Plc 2009 12\\nPartnerships and the development pipeline\\nTelford Homes has maintained its prudent\\napproach to investment in land during the last\\ntwelve months whilst retaining financial resources\\nto deploy in its partnerships with Eastend Homes\\nand Poplar HARCA. The Group reported last year\\nthat these housing transfer organisations are both\\nsignificant land owners in East London and have\\nchosen Telford Homes to be their partner on a\\nnumber of large regeneration schemes.\\nThe British Estate, E3, has set the model for the\\npartnership with Eastend Homes where land\\npayments made by Telford Homes have been\\nreinvested into the third party refurbishment of\\nexisting homes on the estate. The Group has now\\nentered into a contract to build 54 affordable\\nhomes on the St George’s Estate, E1 for Eastend\\nHomes along with a construction contract for\\ninfrastructure works required on the estate. In\\naddition Telford Homes has option contracts over\\nland on the estate to provide 139 open market\\nhomes and these are due from 2010 onwards.\\nConstruction of the affordable homes is now\\nunderway and as such the Group has drawn \\nits first grant tranche from the HCA.\\nTelford Homes continues to progress master plans\\nfor the regeneration of five other estates with\\nEastend Homes and the Group expects to\\ncommence construction of 74 affordable homes\\non the Bede Estate, E3, in autumn 2009. Bede and\\nthe other estates are expected to add in excess\\nof 900 properties to the development pipeline\\nover the next few years and the partnership with\\nPoplar HARCA an additional 400 properties.\\nAs at 31st March 2009 the total pipeline of open\\nmarket and affordable properties not yet legally\\ncompleted was 2,635 including 2,400 with\\nplanning permission. This total includes sites\\nunder option contracts within the control of the\\nGroup. Of these properties 1,503 are under\\nconstruction with 1,115 currently secured by\\ncontracts exchanged either for open market\\nsale or for affordable housing. Open market\\npre-sales contracts totalled £128.4 million at 31st\\nMarch 2009 although some of these will fail \\nto complete leaving the Group with unsold\\nproperty. Affordable housing revenue contracted\\nbut not yet recognised totalled £34.6 million at\\nthe year end and this is secured through payments\\nreceived from housing associations as\\nconstruction progresses.\\nbusiness & financial review\\nDecorum E10\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 11 13     Telford Homes Plc 2009\\nchief executive’s review continued\\nPlanning\\nThe Group’s focus on East London gives Telford\\nHomes significant development presence that\\nengenders respect from the local planning\\nauthorities and the Group has achieved a\\nnumber of important permissions this year. These\\ninclude 193 homes on the St George’s Estate,\\n236 homes on the Bede Estate and 209 homes\\non the Holland Estate. The Group is working \\nwith both Eastend Homes and Poplar HARCA \\nto achieve planning permissions on land owned\\nby them that will later be developed under \\nthe existing partnerships. Only two of the sites\\nowned directly by Telford Homes do not have\\ndetailed planning permission and the Group is\\nprogressing plans on each of these with the \\naim of receiving approvals during 2009.\\nPeople\\nIn December 2008 the Group reported that \\nthe Board expected to reduce the number \\nof people employed by Telford Homes by\\nbetween a quarter and a third before the end of\\n2009, depending on success in securing projects\\nthat do not require a cash investment. The HCA\\ngrant programme and the Group’s expectation\\nof constructing affordable housing on a number\\nof developments gives the Board confidence\\nthat the number of redundancies will be less\\nthan originally feared. As ever, and in particular\\nduring these difficult times with pay frozen and\\nno bonuses being paid, the Board is extremely\\ngrateful for the commitment and effort shown\\nby all of the Group’s employees.\\nConstruction\\nDespite the impact that market conditions and\\nthe redundancy programme have had on\\nmorale, Telford Homes has continued to produce\\nwell designed and well built developments. This is\\na real credit to the work of the operating divisions\\nin a period that has seen continual appraisal of\\nprospects and a consequent re-organisation,\\nalongside redundancies.\\nThe quality of the finished product continues \\nto be ensured by the work of the Telford Homes\\nCustomer Service team that provide quality\\ncontrol and give a consistent ‘face’ to customers.\\nThe delivery of a first rate home is a fundamental\\nstep in the completion process.\\nConstruction is the heart of Telford Homes and\\nHealth and Safety is at the forefront of the\\nGroup’s working practices. The Group has\\ncontinued to develop and monitor its policies\\nand procedures during the year and its very\\ngood record has been maintained. \\nCurrent trading and outlook\\nThe focus at the start of the new financial year\\nremains on maximising positive cash flows into the\\nbusiness including achieving legal completions.\\nAlready since 1st April 2009 over 50 open market\\nhomes have been completed and handed over to\\ncustomers and this progress remains encouraging.\\n0\\n10,000\\n20,000\\n30,000\\n40,000\\n50,000\\n60,000\\nFirst quarter 2009 First quarter 2008 First quarter 2007\\nNumber of new homes starts recorded in January to March of each year \\nSource: NHBC statistics\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 12 Telford Homes Plc 2009 14\\nbusiness & financial review\\nThe Group will continue to work on securing\\nprofitable contracts to construct affordable\\nhousing on some of its sites with the added \\ncash flow benefit to Telford Homes. This will be\\nsubstantially supported by the grant programme\\nwith the HCA and the Group expects to draw up\\nto 60 per cent of its total allocation before 31st\\nMarch 2010. This will partly be utilised as payment\\nfor land purchased from the Group’s development\\npartners. Alongside this, sales and marketing\\nactivity will be concentrated on the completed\\nunits at Queen Mary’s Gate, where we are\\nexperiencing increased interest from potential\\npurchasers, and Romford before turning to other\\nsites again at the appropriate time and when\\nmarket conditions are right.\\nAcross the country construction of new homes has\\nreached a new low for recent years with National\\nHouse-Building Council (“NHBC”) statistics for new\\nhome starts at 16,200 for the first quarter of 2009\\nagainst 37,800 in the first quarter of 2008 and 53,700\\nfor the same period in 2007. This will inevitably lead\\nto an increased shortage of new homes in the next\\nfew years and Telford Homes will be ready to meet\\nthe challenge of satisfying demand when the time\\ncomes. East London will be at the forefront of\\nincreasing the supply of new homes in London \\nas regeneration of the area continues.\\nThe Board is cautiously optimistic in its outlook due\\nto increased activity at Queen Mary’s Gate and\\nlegal completions on pre-sold homes progressing\\nas well as could have been anticipated.

Negotiations with each of the three\\nbanks funding Telford Homes have resulted in\\nnew and extended facilities with appropriate\\ncovenants and I am pleased that the Group’s\\nrelationships with the banks remain as strong as\\never in a very difficult economic climate.\\nAccounting changes\\nOn 25th September 2008 the Group announced\\nchanges to its accounting policies as a result of\\nthe early adoption of two new accounting\\nstandards, IFRIC 15 and IAS 23 (revised). Revenue\\nand profit from the sale of open market private\\nhomes is now recognised on legal completion. \\nIn addition borrowing costs are capitalised within\\ninventories on a site by site basis and expensed\\nthrough cost of sales as and when revenue is\\nrecognised. These changes are reflected in the\\nresults to 31st March 2009 and the previous year\\nhas been restated on the same basis. Further\\ndetails are provided in note 21.\\nIn addition the Group has increased the number\\nof subsidiaries in its ownership during the year with\\ntrading activity taking place in a subsidiary for the\\nfirst time and trading continuing in the Group’s\\njointly controlled entities. As a result the 2009\\nfinancial statements have been prepared as\\nconsolidated Group accounts with comparative\\ninformation provided for 2008.\\nOperating results\\nRevenue increased to £106.7 million from £96.8\\nmillion with 350 open market completions secured\\nat an average price of £253,000. Adjusting for\\nhomes sold through jointly controlled entities,\\nwhere the Group recognises half of the revenue\\nand profit, the total revenue from open market\\nhousing and commercial units in the year was\\n£83.2 million, with a further £22.3 million arising from\\nprogress on construction contracts for affordable\\nhousing and £1.2 million of other income.\\nGross profit before exceptional items was £17.6\\nmillion which is stated after expensing loan interest\\nthat has been capitalised within inventories under\\nthe new accounting standard, IAS 23 (revised).\\nTotal loan interest included within cost of sales was\\n£3.7 million and before charging this interest the\\ngross margin in the year was 20.0 per cent against \\na restated adjusted margin of 21.6 per cent in 2008.\\nDespite a move to undertake lower risk and lower\\nmargin construction work, such as the development\\nof affordable housing, the margin before interest \\nhas held at the Group’s target level for a normal\\neconomic environment. This is primarily due to\\nrevenue and profit being recognised on legal\\ncompletion of properties which were secured \\nby contract before the downturn in the \\nproperty market. \\nIn the coming year Telford Homes expects to\\nundertake more development for housing\\nassociations at lower margins commensurate with\\nthe risk and also expects an increasing number of\\npreviously sold homes to fail to complete at their\\noriginal contract price. Both of these factors will\\nresult in a lower reported margin in the future.\\n15     Telford Homes Plc 2009\\nfinancial review\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 14 Telford Homes Plc 2009 16\\nbusiness & financial review\\nOneStratford E15\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:03  Page 15 The operational teams continue to monitor and\\ncontrol development costs in a period that has\\nseen significant changes in some raw material\\ncosts, due in many cases to adverse movements\\nin exchange rates, but has also seen a gradual\\ndecline in labour and subcontract costs as the\\ndemand for construction work has fallen. The\\nGroup’s commercial teams are focused on\\nachieving cost savings in the coming months\\nand, while maintaining good relationships with \\nall suppliers, they will ensure that Telford Homes\\nachieves appropriate tender prices in the \\ncurrent market.\\nTotal build costs in the year to 31st March 2009\\nwere £79 million up from £76 million last year with\\nthe rate of expenditure declining over the last six\\nmonths as developments have been completed\\nand have not been replaced by new site starts.\\nTelford Homes has taken a cautious approach to\\ncommencing construction on some sites where\\nfuture revenues cannot be substantially secured\\nat an early stage in the development.\\nThe operating margin before exceptional items\\nand interest charged to cost of sales was 11.3 per\\ncent to 31st March 2009, up from 10.6 per cent\\nlast year. Administrative expenses are carefully\\ncontrolled and have reduced year on year by\\nthree per cent. The Group has taken the decision\\nnot to increase salaries or to pay any bonuses to\\nemployees this year while the threat of\\nredundancies remains. Selling expenses are down\\nsignificantly, falling by 41 per cent, in keeping with\\nreduced sales and marketing activity in the last\\ntwelve months.\\nExceptional items\\nThe exceptional items reported in the year to 31st\\nMarch 2009 are primarily write downs to the value\\nof land and work in progress across a number of\\nsites totalling £2.9 million along with £0.1 million in\\nrelation to redundancy costs. The write downs\\nrepresent less than two per cent of the value of\\ninventories. Write downs have not been required\\non developments where the Group expects to\\nconstruct 100 per cent affordable housing at a\\npositive margin.\\nInterest\\nTotal interest paid in the year was £6.4 million\\nreduced from £7.4 million last year. Average\\nborrowings were higher in the year to 31st March\\n2009 at £113 million against £93 million last year\\nand therefore significant savings have been\\nachieved as a result of the fall in the base rate\\nover the course of the last twelve months.

These facilities\\nwere renegotiated in April 2009. At 31st March\\n2009 the Group had utilised £21.2 million of its\\nfacilities with Allied Irish Bank leaving an unutilised\\nbalance on the new facilities of £6.4 million going\\nforward. The facilities expire on different dates\\ndepending on the specific circumstances of\\neach development and are normally repayable\\non build completion of each development from\\nthe sales proceeds received.\\nThe Group’s jointly controlled entity, Bishopsgate\\nApartments LLP, has a fully utilised loan facility\\nwith Allied Irish Bank of £20.0 million in respect of\\nthe purchase of development land in Bethnal\\nGreen Road.

At 31st March 2009\\nthe Group had utilised £7.3 million of these\\nfacilities leaving an unutilised balance of £5.3\\nmillion. The facilities are due for repayment\\nbetween June 2010 and September 2010.\\nAt 31st March 2009 the Group had unutilised\\noverdraft facilities of £3.0 million\\n(2008 - £3.0 million).\\nThese bank facilities ensure that adequate\\nfunding is available to cover working capital\\nrequirements and the Board consider that\\nexisting facilities are sufficient to cover funding\\nrequirements in the foreseeable future. Where\\nfacilities are due to expire within one year this is\\ndue to the timing of development completions\\nand therefore the expected repayment dates. \\nIn all of these cases the loans are expected to\\nbe repaid by the date the facility expires.\\nSome of the Group's bank facilities are subject \\nto a number of general and financial covenants\\nwhich are tested periodically by each bank. In \\nall cases the Board have assessed whether the\\nGroup will remain in compliance with the\\ncovenants in the short to medium term and \\nare satisfied that there will be no breach of the\\ncovenants that cannot be easily rectified.\\nBorrowings at 31st March 2009 were £112.0 million\\n(2008 - £101.4 million) with gearing at 206.6% (2008\\n- 191.5%). Total debt and gearing rose for the first\\nseven months of the year while development work\\ncontinued on sites nearing build completion and\\nreached a peak in October 2008 of £127 million\\nand 275%. The subsequent flow of completion\\nproceeds has enabled significant repayments to\\nbe made and borrowings have now fallen \\nbelow £100 million.\\nTelford Homes continues to monitor ‘uncovered\\ngearing’ which excludes debt matched by the\\nvalue of contracts exchanged on a given\\ndevelopment. This is an important performance\\nindicator in the business and is monitored by all\\nthree banks currently funding Telford Homes.\\nAllowing for the risk that a proportion of secured\\ncontracts fail to complete the level of uncovered\\ngearing at 31st March 2009 remains within\\nacceptable limits at 80.7% (2008 - 65.6%).\\nThe Group’s focus on generating operating\\ncash inflows will result in further reductions in the\\nlevel of debt and gearing in the business over\\nthe next twelve months and this will continue\\nunless additional funding is required for projects\\nwhere the future revenues can be secured at\\nan early stage in the development.\\nBalance sheet\\nNet assets have increased to £50.3 million from\\n£48.9 million and net assets per share at 31st\\nMarch 2009 were 129.8 pence. The Group\\ncontinues to carry forward tax losses arising \\nfrom the change in accounting policies and\\nrestatement of the 2008 figures but expects to\\nutilise remaining losses in the year to 31st March\\n2010 and return to making tax payments.\\nDividends\\nTelford Homes remains cautious in its appraisal \\nof future cash flows and as such the Board has\\ntaken the decision not to pay any dividend in\\nrelation to the year to 31st March 2009. This is a\\nprudent approach reflecting the uncertain\\ntiming of completion proceeds. The Board will\\ncontinue to monitor performance with a view \\nto re-instating a dividend as soon as the Board\\nconsiders it prudent to do so. \\nCash flow\\nControl of cash remains of critical importance \\nand we maintain a detailed month by month \\ncash flow forecast as part of our management\\ninformation systems. This enables the Group to\\ncontinuously monitor forecast and actual cash\\nflows over a five year period and to perform\\nsensitivity analysis on these forecasts. The forecasts\\nare necessarily subject to a number of assumptions\\nand judgements and these are tested on \\na reasonable basis by the sensitivity analysis. \\nThese forecasts and the related sensitivity analysis\\nare reviewed by the Board in detail on a monthly\\nbasis. In addition all of the forecasts and supporting\\ncalculations are made available to each bank\\non a monthly basis.

As a result\\nthe structure of Telford Homes reverted back to\\ntwo operating divisions during the year to 31st\\nMarch 2009. This structure will be kept under\\nreview in the future.\\nAt 31st March 2009 the Group had over 2,600\\nproperties in the development pipeline and\\nthese properties need to be managed through\\nthe planning process, in design and ultimately\\nduring construction. In order to control this\\nprocess Telford Homes is organised into two\\noperating divisions being Alto and Metro. \\nThis structure is necessary in order to manage the\\ndelivery of several hundred homes per annum\\nand ensures management control to yield\\nexcellent design, high standards of construction\\nand delivery on programme. Each division\\npredominantly specialises in certain sizes of\\ndevelopment and styles of construction. Alto are\\nresponsible for over 1,700 of the properties in\\nplanning, design and construction across 10\\ndevelopments and Metro are responsible for \\nover 900 properties across 20 developments.\\nOn the 1st August 2007 Mark Parker and John\\nFitzgerald were appointed to the board to jointly\\ntake on the roles and responsibilities of Group\\nManaging Director.

This confidence is heavily influenced by factors such\\nas interest rates, the availability of mortgage finance, rental incomes, unemployment and increasing\\nconsumer costs for other goods and services. All of these are outside of the Group’s control.\\nThe Group’s policy has been to sell early in the development process, wherever possible, to minimise the risk\\nin each site. This policy has been very successful to date with 74 per cent of properties under construction \\nat 31st March 2009 secured by exchange of contracts. In addition the Sales and Marketing team have\\ndetailed knowledge of the local market and are able to formulate the best sales strategy for each\\ndevelopment and to work with purchasers and prospective purchasers to ensure that all stages of the\\nprocess from reservation to legal completion run as smoothly as possible.\\nLand acquisition\\nThe Group needs new land to maintain a development pipeline and enable the business to continue\\nto operate at a certain capacity. This land needs to be sourced in appropriate locations and where\\noptimum planning consents can be obtained. The appraisal process that determines the price paid\\nfor land is critical in maintaining margins and return on equity at acceptable levels. \\nThe Land Acquisition and Partnerships teams are responsible for sourcing land and our strong relationships\\nwith various land owners including local councils and affordable housing providers play a key role in our\\nability to acquire new sites. In particular our existing partnerships with housing transfer organisations are\\nexpected to be a significant source of land in the next few years. The appraisal process for new sites\\nincludes due diligence by an experienced solicitor and authorisation of all prospective purchases at\\nappropriate levels.\\nPlanning process\\nThe flow of properties through the development pipeline is dependent on achieving suitable planning\\npermission on sites purchased without planning or subject to planning. The process is time consuming\\nand involves an increasing number of supporting reports and detailed consultations with many different\\nbodies. Delays in achieving suitable planning permissions affect the number of properties that can be\\nbrought to market and impact on future timing of cash flows. Failure to achieve a suitable planning\\npermission may lead to cost write offs or reduced margins on individual developments.\\nTelford Homes has extensive knowledge of local planning requirements, excellent relationships with\\nplanning authorities and takes care in the appointment of professional architects, planning consultants\\nand engineers. Early consultations with the planning authorities are a key part of the land acquisition\\nprocess. While this cannot remove planning risks it mitigates them as much as possible. The Group has 235\\nproperties in the development pipeline going through the planning process reduced from 454 last year.\\nHealth and Safety\\nConstruction sites are dangerous places and there are many different health and safety risks to consider.\\nThe health and safety of everyone associated with Telford Homes, both employees and sub-contractors,\\nis the first priority of the Group.\\nInvestment in training, the promotion of health and safety to all employees and extensive policies and\\nprocedures all contribute to a comprehensive approach to health and safety management with the\\nobjective of minimising risk and providing a safe working environment. \\nkey risks and uncertainties\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 26 Construction\\nThe construction process is critical to the efficient and timely delivery of properties to purchasers which\\naffects both cash flow and customer satisfaction. The quality of the construction work and finish in each\\nproperty affects the reputation of the Group and can impact on repeat purchase and\\nrecommendation rates. \\nStandards of construction and control of the building process on site are of paramount importance to each\\noperating division. Careful planning is required to assess a development programme before construction\\ncommences and this is monitored over the course of the building work. The construction teams work very\\nclosely with the Customer Service team and their interaction commences at an early stage in the\\ndevelopment. The Customer Service team spend a substantial proportion of their time on site carrying\\nout quality control before a purchaser sees the property for the first time.\\nAvailability of materials and labour\\nThe availability of materials and sub-contracted labour for each site can affect both the construction\\nprogramme and the cost of construction. Build cost inflation will impact directly on the margin\\nachieved on each site where this is in excess of forecasts.\\nPlanning of the construction programme and timely management of the tender process for each \\nsub-contracted trade reduces the risk of delays in the construction programme due to availability of\\nmaterials and labour. The tender process ensures that competitive rates are achieved on every trade.\\nTelford Homes works in partnership with all of its sub-contractors and makes timely payments to\\nencourage an equal relationship that is beneficial to all parties.\\nCash requirements and bank finance\\nProperty development is a capital intensive business with significant initial outlays supported by bank\\nfinance and lengthy time periods before the majority of the cash inflows on each project. Forecasting\\nof cash flows is critical to ensure the Group is not operating beyond its financial capacity. Part of this\\nprocess involves the forecast of bank funding for each development and the availability of sufficient\\nbank finance is therefore also of critical importance.\\nTelford Homes maintains a detailed cash flow forecast as part of its management information systems.\\nThis extends five years into the future and is subject to continual re-assessment and sensitivity analysis. The\\ncash flow position is reviewed by the Board and by each of the Group’s banking partners on a monthly\\nbasis. Telford Homes has excellent relationships with the three banks currently funding the business and\\nhas sufficient facilities available to ensure the continuing operation of the business on all sites currently\\nunder construction.\\nPolitical environment\\nChanges in laws and regulations can have a direct impact on the efficient running of the Group and\\nthe costs incurred on each development. Changes in both local and national government can have\\na direct bearing on the regulatory environment.\\nTelford Homes works closely with specialist consultants to ensure that it is up to date with current\\nregulations and aware of any future changes so that operations can be planned accordingly. \\nTelford Homes Plc 2009 28\\noperating review\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 27 Telford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 28 corporate responsibility\\nregeneration\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 29 “Telford Homes\\ncontinues to regard\\nthe promotion of\\nhealth and safety as\\na critical objective\\nof all employees\\nat every level”\\nSteve Nicoll \\nGroup Health & Safety Manager\\nTelford Homes continues to regard the promotion\\nof health and safety as a critical objective of all\\nemployees at every level.

Although these estimates are based on the directors best knowledge of the\\namounts, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The most\\nsignificant estimates made by the directors in these financial statements are set out in 'Critical\\naccounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty'.\\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently for all periods presented in\\nthese financial statements except where the Group has taken the option to early adopt IFRIC 15\\n'Agreements for the construction of real estate' and IAS 23 (revised) 'Borrowing costs' from 1st April\\n2008. The prior year comparatives have been restated and further information is given in note 21.\\nBasis of consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its\\nsubsidiaries and the Group's share of jointly controlled entities up to 31st March 2009. The results of\\nsubsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the financial statements from the\\neffective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. All intra-group\\ntransactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\\nExemptions\\nThe directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 230 of the Companies\\nAct 1985 and have not presented an income statement for the Company alone.\\nJointly controlled entities\\nA jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds an interest with one or more other\\nparties where a contractual arrangement has established joint control over the entity. Jointly\\ncontrolled entities are accounted for using proportional consolidation.\\nSegmental reporting\\nThe Group has only one business segment being housebuilding and one geographical segment being\\nthe United Kingdom.\\nRevenue and profit recognition\\nProperties for open market sale\\nRevenue and profit is recognised at the point of legal completion of each property.\\nCommission received on property sales made on behalf of third parties is recorded within revenue,\\nwith all costs associated with the sale of those properties recognised within selling expenses.\\nConstruction contracts\\nContracts are treated as construction contracts when they have been specifically negotiated for the\\nconstruction of a development or a number of properties. These contracts are primarily for the\\nconstruction of affordable homes. Revenue is only recognised on a construction contract where the\\noutcome can be estimated reliably. Revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of\\ncompletion of contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by an\\nassessment of work performed to date.\\nWhere the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is\\nrecognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. When it is\\nprobable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised\\nas an expense immediately.\\nSelling expenses\\nSelling expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred.\\nBorrowings\\nInterest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received.\\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the development of properties that take a substantial period\\nof time to get ready for sale, are capitalised within inventories. Capitalisation of borrowing costs\\ncommences from the date of initial expenditure on a given development and continues until the\\nproperties are ready for sale. \\n31st March 2009\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 56 financial statements\\nThe capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended where land assets are being held for strategic\\npurposes or where there are prolonged periods when development activity on a site is interrupted.\\nCapitalisation is not normally suspended during a period when substantial technical and\\nadministrative work is being carried out.\\nAll other borrowing costs are charged to the income statement using the effective interest method.\\nExceptional items\\nExceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or\\nincidence to enable a full understanding of the Group's financial performance.\\nFinance leases and hire purchase contracts\\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the\\nrisks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\\nAssets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are recognised as assets of the Group\\nat their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined\\nat the inception of the lease and depreciated over the shorter of their expected useful lives and the\\nlease term. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease or hire\\npurchase obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of\\nthe lease obligations so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the\\nliability. Finance charges are charged to the income statement.\\nOperating leases\\nOperating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of\\nthe lease.\\nPension costs\\nContributions paid to group personal pension schemes (defined contribution), in respect of\\nemployees, are charged to the income statement as incurred.\\nProperty, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is\\nprovided on a straight line basis at rates calculated to write down the cost, less estimated residual\\nvalue, of each asset over its expected useful life as follows:\\nLeasehold improvements - shorter of term of lease and 10 years\\nPlant and machinery - 2 to 5 years\\nMotor vehicles - 3 years\\nInvestments\\nInterests in subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost less impairment. \\nInventories\\nDevelopment properties are included in inventories and are stated at the lower of cost and net\\nrealisable value. Cost comprises costs of acquisition and development, including directly attributable\\nfees and expenses, direct labour costs and borrowing costs. Net realisable value has been assessed\\nfor all developments and during the year this assessment led to a write down in the value of land and\\nwork in progress as disclosed in note 1. Included within development properties are freehold interests\\nheld in completed developments. These are held for future sale. \\nFinancial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group's balance sheet when the Group\\nbecomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument.\\nTrade receivables and other receivables\\nTrade receivables on normal terms do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value\\nreduced by appropriate allowances for estimated unrecoverable amounts.\\nCash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents are defined as cash balances in hand and in the bank (including short-\\nterm cash deposits) which mature within three months or less from the date of acquisition.\\nBorrowings\\nInterest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received.\\nTrade payables\\nTrade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.\\nTelford Homes Plc 2009 58\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 57 59     Telford Homes Plc 2009\\nLand creditors\\nWhen land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Group initially records it at its fair value with\\na land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment. Fair value is\\ndetermined by using the effective interest method. The difference between the nominal value and\\nthe initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance\\ncosts, increasing the value of the land creditor so that at the date of maturity, the land creditor\\nequals the payment required.\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual\\narrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in\\nthe assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are\\nrecorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\\nCurrent assets and liabilities\\nAssets that are expected to be realised in, or are intended for sale or consumption in, the Group's\\nnormal operating cycle are treated as current even to the extent these are expected to be realised\\nafter twelve months from the balance sheet date. Liabilities that are expected to be settled in the\\nGroup's normal operating cycle are treated as current even though these may be due for settlement\\nafter twelve months from the balance sheet date.\\nContingent liabilities\\nDisclosures are made for each class of contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date detailing,\\nwhere practicable, an estimate of its financial effect and an indication of uncertainties associated\\nwith the timing or amount of the outflow, unless the possibility of a financial outflow is remote.\\nTaxation\\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\\nThe tax currently payable is based on the profits for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit \\nas reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are tax\\ndeductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The\\nGroup's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively\\nenacted by the balance sheet date.\\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not\\nreversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay\\nmore tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.\\nA net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis\\nof all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable\\ntaxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.\\nDeferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged\\nor credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.\\nShare-based payments\\nIn accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of equity settled share options granted is recognised as an\\nemployee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.

This amendment prohibits the presentation of\\nitems of income and expense (that is 'non-owner changes in equity') in the statement of changes in\\nequity. Revised IAS 1 also sets out the additional disclosure requirements for entities making restatements\\nor reclassifications. It will apply to the Group from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009.\\nIFRS 2 (Amendment) 'Share-based payment'. This amendment clarifies that vesting conditions are\\nservice and performance conditions only. It also specifies that all cancellations should receive the\\nsame accounting treatment, whether cancelled by the entity or by other parties. The amendment \\nwill apply to the Group from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009.\\nThe following standards, amendments and interpretations are not expected to have any material\\nimpact on the financial statements of the Group:\\nIFRS 3 (Amendment) 'Business combinations' applies to the Group from the annual period\\ncommencing 1st April 2010. This standard includes some significant changes to how the acquisition\\nmethod is applied to business combinations.\\nIFRS 7 (Amendment) 'Financial instruments: Disclosures'. This amendment increases the disclosure\\nrequirements for fair value measurement. It will apply to the Group from the annual period\\ncommencing 1st April 2009.\\nIFRS 8 'Operating segments' applies to the Group from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009.\\nIFRS 8 amends the current segmental reporting requirement of IAS 14 and requires 'management\\napproach' to be adopted so that segment information is presented on the same basis as that used\\nfor internal reporting purposes. \\nIAS 27 (Amendment) 'Consolidated and separate financial statements' applies to the Group from the\\nannual period commencing 1st April 2010. The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions\\nwith non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control.\\nIAS 32 (Amendment) 'Financial instruments: Presentation' and IAS 1 (Amendment) 'Presentation of\\nfinancial statements - Puttable instruments and instruments with obligations arising on liquidation'\\napplies to the Group from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009.\\nIAS 39 (Amendment) 'Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement - Eligible hedged items’\\napplies to the Group from the 1st April 2010.\\nIFRIC 13 'Customer loyalty programmes' applicable to the Group from the annual period\\ncommencing 1st April 2009.\\nIFRIC 16 'Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation' applicable to the Group from the annual\\nperiod commencing 1st April 2009.\\nIFRIC 17 'Distributions of non-cash assets to owners' applicable to the Group from the annual period\\ncommencing 1st April 2010.\\nIFRIC 18 'Transfer of assets from customers' applicable to the Group from the annual period\\ncommencing 1st April 2010.\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 59 notes to the financial statements\\n61     Telford Homes Plc 2009\\n1 Operating profit Year ended Year ended\\n31st March 2009 31st March 2008\\nrestated \\n£000 £000\\nOperating profit is stated after charging (crediting):\\nDepreciation - owned assets 302 271\\n- hire purchase assets 85 128\\nOperating lease rentals - property 163 162\\n- motor vehicles 387 216\\nProfit on sale of tangible assets (39) (24)\\nExceptional items 2,984 -\\nThe exceptional items for the year ended 31st March 2009 of £3.0 million include £2.9 million where\\nthe net realisable value of land and work in progress on certain developments has been assessed to\\nbe lower than the costs originally recorded in inventories as a result of the deterioration in market\\nconditions and £0.1 million of redundancy costs.\\nYear ended Year ended\\n31st March 2009 31st March 2008\\n£000 £000\\nThe following has been charged in respect of auditors’ remuneration:\\nAudit and related services (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP)\\nStatutory audit of the Parent Company and Group financial statements 65 59\\nOther services including non-audit services (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP)\\nThe audit of jointly controlled entity accounts pursuant to legislation 8 7\\nOther services provided pursuant to such legislation - -\\nOther services relating to taxation 52 23\\nAll other services 27 21\\nAmounts payable to the Company’s auditors and their associates in respect of services to the\\nCompany, other than the audit of the Company’s financial statements have not been disclosed as\\nthe information is required instead to be disclosed on a consolidated basis.\\n31st March 2009\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 60 financial statements\\nTelford Homes Plc 2009 62\\n2 Employee benefit expense\\nThe average monthly number of persons employed by the Group and Company, including executive\\ndirectors, during the year analysed by activity was as follows:\\nYear ended Year ended\\n31st March 2009 31st March 2008\\nNumber Number\\nConstruction 100 88\\nAdministration 73 62\\n173 150\\nThe employment costs of all employees included above were:\\nYear ended Year ended\\n31st March 2009 31st March 2008\\n£000 £000\\nWages and salaries 7,945 8,045\\nSocial security costs 870 901\\nOther pension costs - group personal pension arrangements 395 324\\n9,210 9,270\\nThe Company operates a group personal pension scheme for its employees.

This charge is calculated at the date\\nof grant of the options and is charged equally over the vesting period.

This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and\\nconfers certain tax advantages for participating employees.\\nThe SIP provides for employees to purchase shares up to a value of £1,500 in each tax year. These\\nshares are known as 'Partnership shares'. Partnership shares are matched on a one for one basis by\\n'Matching shares' provided by the Group subject to the shares remaining in the SIP for a period not\\nless than three years. Dividends are paid on both Partnership and Matching shares and these are\\nallocated to employees as 'Dividend shares'.\\nThe Group has set up a trust to administer the SIP and to hold shares on behalf of individual\\nemployees. This trust is an entirely separate entity to the Group and is managed by a corporate\\ntrustee, Telford Homes Trustees Limited. The costs associated with the trust are paid for by the Group\\nand the Group finances all share purchases.\\nThe trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating\\nin the scheme. These shares remain in the trust until such time as an employee withdraws from the SIP.\\nFurther shares have been allocated to employees as Matching shares and the cost of these shares is\\nbeing written off over the three year holding period. The charge in the year ended 31st March 2009 is\\n£131,000 (2008 - £109,000).\\nDuring the year ended 31st March 2009 the trust acquired 292 shares at 98.0p in August 2008, a further\\n500,000 shares at 104.5p in August 2008 and a further 750,000 shares at 26.5p in March 2009. At 31st\\nMarch 2009 the trust remains interested in 27,242 shares (2008 - 7,343) which have not been allocated\\nto employees and a further 731,913 (2008 - 217,489) that have been allocated to employees as\\nMatching shares but have not yet vested. Shares in which the trust remains interested do not rank for\\ndividends and all shares that have not yet vested do not count in the calculation of the weighted\\naverage numbers of shares used to calculate earnings per share.\\nShares held by the SIP are recognised as a deduction from shareholders’ funds. The value of these\\nshares at 31st March 2009 was £700,126 (2008 - £305,000). Movements in the profit and loss reserve\\nrelating to the SIP are shown in the statement of changes in equity.\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 71 73     Telford Homes Plc 2009\\n17 Employee Share Schemes (continued)\\nTelford Homes Plc 2006 Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan\\nDuring the year ended 31st March 2007 Telford Homes Plc set up a Deferred Payment Share Purchase\\nPlan (DPSPP) for the benefit of selected senior employees. An employee benefit trust (the Telford Homes\\nPlc 2006 Employee Benefit Trust) was set up with Abacus Corporate Trustee Limited acting as trustee.\\nParticipants in the DPSPP are offered a loan by the trustee to enable them to subscribe for a specified\\nnumber of shares in the Group at market value. This loan is interest free repayable on or before the\\nrepayment date which is normally ten years from the date of the loan or on leaving employment or\\ndisposing of the shares. The loan has a limited recourse such that repayment is limited to the value of the\\nshares on the repayment date. The Group will lend the trustee sufficient funds to enable the trustee to\\nprovide the loans to individual participants. All shares acquired under the DPSPP will be subject to a three\\nyear vesting period and are held by the trustee for the benefit of the participants. Offers to participants\\nwill be made periodically at the discretion of the directors of Telford Homes Plc.\\nIn September 2006 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 550,000 shares at the\\nmarket value of 260p. These shares were issued on 9th November 2006. On this date the Group provided\\na loan to the trustee of £1,430,000 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. This\\nloan is repayable at the earlier of the sale of the vested shares and November 2016 and has been\\nrecognised as a deduction from shareholders' funds in the statement of changes in equity.\\nIn December 2007 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 160,000 shares at the\\nmarket value of 244p. These shares were issued on 14th December 2007. On this date the Group provided\\na loan to the trustee of £390,400 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. This\\nloan is repayable at the earlier of the sale of the vested shares and December 2017 and has been\\nrecognised as a deduction from shareholders' funds in the statement of changes in equity.\\n18 Commitments and contingent liabilities\\nCommitments\\nAt 31st March the Group and Company had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease\\npayments under non-cancellable operating leases which fall due as follows:\\nProperty leases                    Other leases\\n2009 2008 2009 2008\\n£000 £000 £000 £000\\nWithin one year 184 184 300 201\\nBetween one and five years 737 737 215 320\\nOver five years 292 476 - -\\n1,213 1,397 515 521\\nOperating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Company for its office premises and\\nmotor vehicles.\\nContingent liabilities\\nOn 23rd August 2005 the Company entered an agreement to purchase the site of the former halls of\\nresidence of Queen Mary and Westfield College in South Woodford.

All land\\ncreditors are due within one year.\\nBorrowings\\nThe Group uses loan finance, all of which is denominated in sterling, to acquire development land\\nand undertake site construction. Existing loans and loan facilities are in place with three banks and\\nare secured by a debenture over the assets of the Group and by charges over the development \\nsites owned by the Group.\\nAt 31st March 2009 the Group had unutilised overdraft facilities of £3.0 million (2008 - £3.0 million).\\nThe Group has site specific loan facilities with Allied Irish Bank totalling £27.6 million in respect of\\ncertain development sites. At 31st March 2009 the Group had utilised £21.2 million of these facilities\\nleaving an unutilised balance of £6.4 million. The facilities expire on different dates depending on the\\nspecific circumstances of each development and are normally repayable on completion of each\\ndevelopment from the sales proceeds received.

At 31st March 2009 Bishopsgate Apartments LLP had utilised all £20.0 million of this facility. The\\nGroup has recorded its 50% share of the loan in its balance sheet at 31st March 2009. The facility is on\\na rolling one year term and the bank had not served a notice to require repayment within one year\\nas at the date of signing the financial statements. \\nThe Group has site specific loan facilities with The Royal Bank of Scotland totalling £66.3 million in\\nrespect of certain development sites.

The facilities expire on different dates depending\\non the specific circumstances of each development and are normally repayable on completion of\\neach development from the sales proceeds received. Of the utilised loans of £62.2 million, £43.3\\nmillion is due for repayment within one year, £16.0 million is due for repayment after more than one\\nyear and less than two years and £2.9 million is due for repayment after more than two years and less\\nthan five years.\\nIn addition the Group’s jointly controlled entity, Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited, has a loan facility\\nwith The Royal Bank of Scotland of £51.3 million in respect of the purchase of development land and\\nconstruction in Greenwich. At 31st March 2009 Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited had utilised £16.2\\nmillion of this facility leaving an unutilised balance of £35.1 million. The Group has recorded its 50%\\nshare of the loan in its balance sheet at 31st March 2009.

The facilities are due for repayment between June 2010 and\\nSeptember 2010.\\nInterest is charged on all of the Group's facilities at either base rate plus a margin of between 2.5%\\nand 4.0% or LIBOR plus a margin of between 2.0% and 3.0%. \\nMarket risk\\nThe Group is exposed to the financial risk of changes in interest rates both in terms of changes in the\\nbase rate and LIBOR and in terms of individual banks attitude to market risk and their application of\\neither base rate or LIBOR to new facilities and the margin applied to each new facility.\\nIn order to assess the risk interest costs are forecast on a monthly basis over a five year period using\\nestimates of likely changes in rates and actual costs are compared to this forecast. Volatility of interest\\ncosts remained at an acceptable level in the year ended 31st March 2009 with the impact of falling\\nbase rates partially offset by a number of the Group's facilities becoming linked to LIBOR as they fell\\ndue for renewal. Interest on all facilities currently held is charged at floating interest rates and the\\nGroup assesses the requirement for fixing interest rates on a regular basis.\\nThe effect on the income statement of a 1% rise and a 1% fall in interest rates has been calculated to\\nassess interest rate sensitivity. Based on average monthly borrowings in the year, a 1% rise in interest\\nrates would have a negative effect of £1,252,000 before tax (2008 - £988,000), a 1% fall in interest\\nrates gives the same but opposite effect.\\nCapital risk\\nThe Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a\\ngoing concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst\\nmaintaining an appropriate capital structure to reduce the costs of capital. The Group considers its\\ncapital to be all of the components of net assets.\\nThe Group ensures that there are appropriate controls over the purchase of land and levels of work in\\nprogress in the business in order to appropriately manage its capital. In addition, the other methods\\nby which the Group can manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the\\nlevel of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders, issuing new share capital and arranging debt.\\nCredit risk\\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.\\nTrade and other receivables includes amounts recoverable on contracts which are due from housing\\nassociations and balances due from other Group undertakings. The Group considers the credit quality\\nof the various debtors to be good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is\\nconsidered to be low.\\nSurplus cash is held in secure bank deposit accounts with Allied Irish Bank, The Royal Bank of Scotland\\nand Barclays Bank.\\nLiquidity risk\\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its\\nobligations as they fall due.\\nThe Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows over a\\nfive year period and performing sensitivity analysis on these forecasts. The forecasts are necessarily\\nsubject to a number of assumptions and judgements and these are tested on a reasonable basis by\\nthe sensitivity analysis. These forecasts and the related sensitivity analysis are reviewed by the directors\\nin detail on a monthly basis. In addition all of the forecasts and supporting calculations are made\\navailable to each bank funding the Group on a monthly basis. The current forecasts show positive\\ncash balances beyond the next twelve months even where this is subjected to sensitivity testing and\\nat no time is the Group forecasting to make use of its overdraft facilities.\\nThe Group utilises bank facilities to ensure that adequate funding is available to cover working capital\\nrequirements and the directors consider that existing facilities are sufficient to cover funding requirements\\nin the foreseeable future both where these have already been utilised and where they are currently\\nunutilised. Where facilities are due to expire within one year this is due to the timing of the relevant\\ndevelopments and therefore the expected repayment dates. In all of these cases the directors are\\nsatisfied that the loans are expected to be repaid by the date the facility expires.\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 75 77     Telford Homes Plc 2009\\n20 Financial instruments (continued)\\nSome of the Group's bank facilities are subject to a number of general and financial covenants which\\nare tested periodically by each bank. In all cases the directors have assessed whether the Group will\\nremain in compliance with the covenants for at least twelve months after signing the financial\\nstatements and are satisfied that there will be no breach of the covenants that cannot be easily\\nrectified. In isolated cases it is possible that on professional valuation of the gross development value\\nof certain sites, should these be required by the relevant bank, there may be a breach of current loan\\nto gross development value covenants as this would be subject to a third party opinion of current\\nmarket values at any time. The directors have assessed situations where this may occur on a prudent\\nbasis and concluded that, whilst it is considered extremely unlikely that any loan repayments will be\\nrequired given recent discussions with each bank, necessary loan repayments to correct any such\\nbreach could be accommodated by forecast future cash resources.\\nThe maturity profile of financial liabilities for the Group is as follows:\\nTrade Land Borrowings Net hire Total\\npayables creditors purchase\\nliabilities\\n£000 £000 £000 £000 £000\\nWithin one year 8,573 2,596 43,306 18 54,493\\nMore than one year and - - 39,777 - 39,777\\nless than two years\\nMore than two years and - - 28,937 - 28,937\\nless than five years\\n31st March 2009 8,573 2,596 112,020 18 123,207\\nTrade Land Borrowings Net hire Total\\npayables creditors purchase\\nliabilities\\n£000 £000 £000 £000 £000\\nWithin one year 8,126 13,696 38,042 83 59,947\\nMore than one year and - - 49,816 18 49,834\\nless than two years\\nMore than two years and - - 13,566 - 13,566\\nless than five years\\n31st March 2008 8,126 13,696 101,424 101 123,347\\nnotes to the financial statements\\n31st March 2009\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 76 financial statements\\nTelford Homes Plc 2009 78\\n21 Early adoption of IFRIC 15 and IAS 23 (revised)\\nIFRIC 15 'Agreements for the construction of real estate'\\nIFRIC Interpretation 15 ‘Agreements for the construction of real estate’ was issued on 3rd July 2008\\nand is effective for periods beginning on or after 1st January 2009. The Group has taken up the option\\nof adopting IFRIC 15 from 1st April 2008.\\nIFRIC 15 has arisen due to differing opinions on whether the revenue from certain real estate\\ntransactions should be recognised in accordance with IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ or in accordance with IAS \\n11 ‘Construction contracts’. The guidance in the existing standards allows flexibility in the accounting\\ntreatment that should be adopted.\\nThe Group has historically accounted for revenues and therefore profits from all property sales in\\naccordance with IAS 11. Under IAS 11 revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis\\nonce contracts for the sale of a property have been exchanged and then only if the eventual profit\\nfrom that property can be foreseen with reasonable certainty.\\nIFRIC 15 concludes that revenue from open market sales of real estate should be accounted for on\\nlegal completion of the properties in accordance with IAS 18. The sale of properties under certain\\nterms within specific construction contracts will continue to be accounted for under IAS 11 and in the\\nGroup’s case this applies to all sales of affordable homes. The accounting treatment for affordable\\nhomes is therefore unaffected by IFRIC 15.\\nThe Group now recognises revenue from the sale of open market private homes and commercial\\nunits entirely at the point of legal completion in accordance with IAS 18. As a result of adopting IAS \\n18 all selling expenses previously capitalised within inventories and included within cost of sales when\\nrevenue was recognised are now expensed as incurred unless they relate to the creation of a\\ntangible asset such as a fixed sales office. These selling expenses are charged after gross profit but\\nwithin operating profit.\\nThe most significant impact of IFRIC 15 on the reported results of Telford Homes is therefore the\\ndeferral of profits previously recognised from the point of exchange of contracts onwards until the\\npoint of legal completion. \\nIAS 23 (revised) 'Borrowing costs'\\nIAS 23 (revised) ‘Borrowing costs’ is effective for periods beginning on or after 1st January 2009. The\\nGroup has taken up the option of adopting IAS 23 (revised) from 1st April 2008. \\nIAS 23 (revised) requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition,\\nconstruction or production of qualifying assets as part of the cost of those assets. Qualifying assets are\\nthose that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale. Previously, under the existing IAS\\n23, an entity was able to choose whether to capitalise borrowing costs or to write them off as incurred.\\nEach development undertaken by the Group represents a qualifying asset under IAS 23 (revised) due\\nto the period of time taken in obtaining planning consent and completing construction on the site.\\nEach development typically has site specific finance and therefore borrowing costs can be directly\\nattributed to each site.\\nAs a result of the adoption of IFRIC 15 the impact of IAS 23 (revised) is typically to defer the expensing\\nof borrowing costs to the income statement. Previously borrowing costs were written off as incurred\\nover the life of each development and now a substantial proportion will not be expensed until legal\\ncompletion of the open market private homes.\\nA restated income statement and balance sheet for the year ended 31st March 2008 are included on\\npages 80 to 81. The only changes required to cash flow statements previously reported are presentational.\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 77 79     Telford Homes Plc 2009\\n21 Early adoption of IFRIC 15 and IAS 23 (revised) (continued)\\nImpact on income statement for the year ended 31st March 2008\\nRevenue for the year ended 31st March 2008 is reduced by £63.3 million as a result of the timing\\ndifference between contract exchanges and legal completions under IFRIC 15. Revenue is reduced\\nby a further £0.4 million as a result of IAS 23 (revised) and the modest effect it has on the percentage\\ncompletion of affordable homes.\\nCost of sales for the year ended 31st March 2008 is reduced by £50.7 million as a result of the change\\nin recognition of revenue under IFRIC 15 and the separate write off of selling expenses. Under IAS 23\\n(revised) cost of sales is increased by £3.6 million where finance costs have been capitalised within\\ninventories and released to cost of sales as revenue is recognised.\\nAdministrative expenses for the year ended 31st March 2008 are increased by £45,000 due to\\ndepreciation of sales offices now recognised as tangible assets. Other selling expenses are now\\nwritten off as incurred increasing total expenses by a further £2.3 million.\\nFinance costs in the year ended 31st March 2008 are reduced by £7.8 million as these are capitalised\\nunder IAS 23 (revised). Remaining finance costs relate to non development specific costs and bank\\ninterest on developments where capitalisation has been suspended.\\nProfit before income tax is reduced from £17.7 million to £6.5 million. The income tax expense is\\nrestated by 30 percent of the net impact on profit before income tax.\\nImpact on balance sheet as at 31st March 2008\\nProperty, plant and equipment is increased by £85,000 at 31st March 2008 as a result of the cost of\\nconstructing sales offices now being recognised as tangible assets rather than forming part of inventories.\\nInventories at 31st March 2008 increased by £97.4 million as a result of the deferral of revenue\\nrecognition to the point of legal completion under IFRIC 15 and therefore the consequent reduction\\nin inventories charged to cost of sales. Capitalisation of finance costs under IAS 23 (revised) further\\nincreases inventories by £7.3 million.\\nReceivables at 31st March 2008 reduced by £125.9 million under IFRIC 15 as a result of revenue on open\\nmarket homes now only being recognised as completion proceeds are received. A further reduction of\\n£0.8 million results from the change in percentage completion on affordable sales as a result of\\ncapitalising finance costs under IAS 23 (revised). An element of receivables then become payable\\nbalances primarily representing deposits received in advance and are reclassified as such.\\nAs a result of the significant deferral of profits previously recognised up to 31st March 2008 into future\\nyears the previous income tax liability becomes an income tax asset of £4.6 million created by the\\nimpact of both IFRIC 15 and IAS 23 (revised).\\nThe movements in retained earnings at 31st March 2008 represent the cumulative adjustments to the\\nincome statement reducing retained profits by £19.9 million as a result of IFRIC 15 and increasing\\nthem by £4.5 million as a result of IAS 23 (revised). \\nNet assets and therefore total equity are reduced from £64.2 million to £48.9 million at 31st March 2008.\\nnotes to the financial statements\\n31st March 2009\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:04  Page 78 financial statements\\nTelford Homes Plc 2009 80\\nGroup income statement reconciliation for the year ended 31st March 2008\\nPreviously IFRIC 15 IAS 23 Restated \\nreported \\n£000 £000 £000 £000\\nRevenue\\nSales of properties 159,626 (63,264) (392) 95,970\\nOther direct income 807 -

These sales secure the \\nrecognition of profit for Telford Homes and \\nour new joint venture partner, The William \\nPears Group, when the homes are handed \\nover in 2013 and 2014.\\nReduced output and margins will continue \\nto keep profits at a lower level in the new \\nfinancial year but these effects will have \\nsubstantially been worked through the \\nbusiness by March 2012. Beyond this date \\nthe Board expects significant growth in the \\nnumber of finished homes from the existing \\ndevelopment pipeline and has secured \\npre-sales on some of those developments \\nat normal margins. The signing of our new \\nbank facility in March this year will improve \\nour ability to add to the development \\npipeline for future years in a climate where \\nmany smaller developers are struggling to \\naccess finance.\\nAs a result the Board is maintaining a \\nprogressive dividend policy in proposing a \\nfinal dividend of 1.25 pence making a total \\nof 2.5 pence for the year (2010: 2.0 pence).\\nFinally it gives me great pleasure to welcome \\nJon Di-Stefano as our new Chief Executive \\nwith effect from 1 July 2011. Jon replaces \\nAndrew Wiseman and I am confident that \\nTelford Homes will continue to prosper under \\nhis leadership. After ten years in our current \\nroles Andrew will take over from me on his full \\ntime return to Telford Homes in January 2012, \\nassuming the position of Executive Chairman, \\nthus retaining his skills and knowledge within \\nthe business.

As a result of this and continued sales \\nof affordable housing to our housing association partners, \\nthe Group has revenue secured by contracts exchanged \\nof over £135 million to flow into the business over the  \\nnext three years.\\nSales and completions\\nTelford Homes is in the middle of a two year period \\nduring which the number of open market homes being \\nfinished is lower than capacity. The Group refrained from \\ninvesting in new land during the recession and, given the \\naverage construction period for a development is two \\nyears, this is affecting the number of homes available  \\nfor sale and legal completion up to the middle of 2012. \\nTherefore the decline in the number of open market \\ncompletions in the year to 31 March 2011 is caused more \\nby the reduced supply of finished homes than by market \\ndemand or the ability to make sales. Overall sales \\nperformance has been better than expected due to the \\nsuccessful off-plan marketing of developments that are \\ndue to be finished between mid-2012 and mid-2014.\\nProfit margins in the year to 31 March 2011 have been \\naffected by changes made during the recession to \\nfavour affordable housing and by impaired open market \\ndevelopments that were acquired by the Group in 2006 \\nand 2007. As expected this combination of reduced \\nsupply of finished open market homes and lower profit \\nmargins has brought total profits in the business down. \\nThe impact of both will continue into the year to \\n31\\xa0March 2012 such that the Board expects profit \\nbefore exceptional items to be similar year-on-year. \\nAlmost all of the developments that switched to \\naffordable housing and those impaired by prices falling \\nduring the recession will have worked through the \\ndevelopment pipeline by the end of the new financial year.\\nThe rate of sales of finished homes to UK buyers  \\nhas remained steady and visitor levels to the Group’s \\nsales centres have been consistent during the year. \\nConstruction of the third and final phase of Queen \\nMary’s Gate in Woodford finished towards the end  \\nof 2010 and we now have fewer than 60 homes left  \\nto sell out of nearly 500 across the development. In \\nSeptember 2010 the Group acquired The Royal Bank  \\nof Scotland’s 50 per cent interest in Telford Homes \\n(Creekside) Limited, the joint venture set up to develop \\nGreenwich Creekside. This development is undergoing  \\na period of phased handovers and over half of the  \\n121 open market homes in the first phase have now \\nbeen handed over to their purchasers.\\nThe availability of mortgage finance for new build \\nproperties remains the most significant restriction  \\non demand in the UK and this is particularly true for first  \\ntime buyers. Bank of England statistics show mortgage \\napprovals have been continuing at a steady rate, albeit at \\njust 40 per cent of the long term average.

Avant-garde is located just  \\na few minutes from Liverpool Street station and over \\n120 off-plan sales have been secured with buyers in \\nthe Far East, an unprecedented performance for this \\ntype of development. There has been equally strong \\noff-plan demand in the recovering London market \\nsuch that in total over 170 of the 257 open market \\nhomes have been sold in just two months of initial \\nmarketing. Construction is underway and handovers  \\nwill take place from late 2013 onwards.\\nThe majority of overseas sales are secured with a 20 \\nper cent deposit either all paid at contract exchange  \\nor paid in stages not later than one year before \\ncompletion. This provides the Group with equity to be \\nused for further site acquisitions and the repayment of \\ndebt. The Group will continue to market appropriate \\ndevelopments overseas to secure revenue that will  \\nbe recognised on legal completions in future years.\\nPartnerships and affordable housing\\nTelford Homes remains a grant partner of the  \\nHomes and Communities Agency (“HCA”) and has now \\ncompleted the first four developments under its 2008 \\nto 2011 grant agreement. The Group has received £55.1 \\nmillion out of a total grant allocation of £72.9 million and \\nthe vast majority of the remainder will be received \\nby March 2012 as affordable homes are completed in \\naccordance with their construction programmes.\\nThe Group has a secured revenue stream contracted for \\nthe affordable housing on all of its current developments \\nand is now developing a greater proportion of open \\nmarket housing such that it is not reliant on future, \\nuncertain, grant funding. New opportunities are \\nappraised on a conditional basis until the value and \\namount of affordable housing required is clear.\\nThe Spending Review has had a significant impact on \\nthe new four year affordable housing grant programme \\nfor 2011 to 2015. Central funding for new projects is \\nexpected to be around 25 per cent of the total grant \\nallocation for 2008 to 2011 and housing associations \\nhave been invited to close the funding gap by charging \\nhigher rents to new tenants under the new ‘affordable \\nrent’ model. This will only partially substitute for the \\nreduction in government funding and therefore less \\naffordable housing will be built. \\nThere remains a housing shortage in London and \\nTelford Homes will continue to work with both the HCA \\nand the local authorities to address the need for new \\nhousing developments to be brought forward and to \\nprovide affordable housing whilst ensuring that each \\nnew development remains financially viable.\\nl and acquisition\\nThe developments in the Group’s ownership during \\n2008 and 2009 were in good locations and were flexible \\nin terms of housing mix such that write downs were \\nless than three per cent of total assets and profitable \\ndevelopment could proceed with increased levels of \\naffordable housing. However the impact of not investing \\nin new sites during the recession, albeit a necessity at \\nthe time, is now being felt in terms of reduced output.\\nIn February 2010 Telford Homes raised £7.2 million  \\nof equity through a placing of new shares to bolster  \\nthe Group’s ability to purchase land. In addition to this \\nthe Board was delighted to sign a three and a half year \\n£70 million banking facility with The Royal Bank of \\nScotland, HSBC and Santander on 31 March 2011.  \\nThe process to secure this finance involved a year of \\nextensive investigation of every aspect of the business \\nand its financial position.

In addition the Group has recently agreed \\nterms with HSBC to finance the joint venture that is \\nresponsible for Avant-garde and as such will have \\nfinance in place for every one of its developments. \\nOperating results\\nRevenue fell to £121.1 million (2010: £159.3 million)  \\nwith gross profit before exceptional items of £15.4 \\nmillion (2010: £21.0 million). Gross profit is stated after \\nexpensing loan interest that has been capitalised within \\ninventories of £2.9 million (2010: £5.3 million) and before \\ncharging this interest the gross margin in the year was \\n15.1 per cent compared to 16.5 per cent last year. \\nThe reductions in revenue and margin are primarily \\ndue to lower output of finished homes and a higher \\nthan normal proportion of affordable housing under \\nconstruction, both of which were as anticipated.\\nProfit margins will remain lower than usual next year \\nbut the impact of those sites that were impaired by \\nthe effects of the recession will have been almost fully \\naccounted for in twelve months time and as such the \\nGroup will be back to more normal margins for the  \\nyear to 31 March 2013.\\nThe operational teams continue to monitor and  \\ncontrol development costs with a focus on achieving \\ncost savings wherever possible, while maintaining \\ngood relationships with all suppliers. Some savings \\nhave been made in the light of reduced development \\nactivity in London although raw material costs can  \\nbe volatile and occasionally the Group holds stock  \\nof materials such as steel to maximise the benefit \\nwhen prices are lower.\\nAdministrative expenses have remained under  \\nclose control and have fallen to £9.3 million (2010: \\n£9.7 million) mainly due to lower employee bonus \\npayments. Selling expenses have increased by 42  \\nper cent to £2.7 million (2010: £1.9 million) in line with \\nthe increase in the number of contracts exchanged  \\nin the year. Overseas selling events are a significant \\ninvestment regardless of the level of success but \\nwhere a large number of sales are secured this is \\nreducing the marketing expenditure needed in  \\nthe future. Unfortunately the required accounting \\ntreatment for selling expenses does not enable the \\nGroup to match revenues with costs in relation to \\noverseas events. The costs must be expensed as \\nincurred even though profit recognition from any  \\nsales made is two to three years in the future.\\nExceptional items\\nOn 17 September 2010 the Group acquired the other 50 per \\ncent of Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited, the joint venture \\nset up to develop Greenwich Creekside, from The Royal \\nBank of Scotland. Their interest was acquired for the sum  \\nof £500 with all existing equity injected by the bank being \\nconverted to debt. As a result the Group recognised a \\n‘bargain gain’ of £511,000 on the acquisition representing \\nthe value of 50 per cent of the net assets of Telford Homes \\n(Creekside) Limited on 17\\xa0September\\xa02010 less the £500 \\npurchase price. This gain is shown as an exceptional item  \\nin the income statement to 31\\xa0March\\xa02011.

The \\nsecurity of funding provided by the new longer term \\nbanking facility attracts a higher rate of interest at 3.5 \\nper cent over LIBOR and this will increase the average \\nrate of interest paid on borrowings in the new financial \\nyear. The benefits of the new facility far outweigh this \\nincreased cost and the rate is competitive in the current \\nmarket compared to other developers.\\nFor the first time the Board has agreed to take  \\nout some protection against future interest rates. \\nAlthough the Board does not believe significant rate \\nrises are likely in the near future the cost of interest \\nrate protection is currently quite low for the same \\nreason and as such it is worth investing a small \\namount to protect the business and ensure that \\ninterest cover covenants remain achievable. The Group \\nhas purchased a cap on LIBOR of three per cent on \\n£30 million of debt which expires in September 2014. \\nThe cost of this cap was £290,000 paid up front and \\nthis will be expensed over the term of the product.\\nInterest charged to the income statement includes \\n£2.9 million in cost of sales (2010: £5.3 million) and a \\nfurther £1.1 million of finance costs (2010: £1.7 million) \\nmainly as a result of suspending the capitalisation of \\ninterest on certain sites that were not progressing in \\nterms of design or construction for parts of the year.\\ndividend\\nThe Board has decided to propose a final dividend of  \\n1.25 pence which, together with the 1.25 pence interim \\ndividend paid on 14 January 2011, makes a total dividend \\nfor the year of 2.5 pence (2010: 2.0 pence).

The Group has remained \\nprofitable, increased its volume of sales due to pre-selling \\ndevelopments that will complete in future years and \\nsecured finance for the next three and a half years  \\nand hence the Board believes the current share price  \\nto be significantly undervalued.\\nCash balances remain high at 31 March 2011  \\nat £18.8 million although down from £33.6 million  \\nlast year. This balance includes operational balances  \\nof £12.7 million and grant monies held for future \\nexpenditure of £6.1 million. The cash balance was \\ninflated on the final day of the year by the first \\ndrawdown under the new banking facility which \\ngenerated funds over and above the repayment  \\nof previous facilities of £7.1 million.\\nCash balances were expected to reduce over the  \\nyear both through ongoing expenditure of grant \\nmonies held and also through investment of the \\nplacing funds received in March 2010. The cash flow \\nstatement shows that the Group has made a net \\ninvestment in working capital this year as opposed to \\nthe significant reduction in work in progress last year.\\nOn 30 September 2010 the Group announced that it \\nhad repaid all of the outstanding loan notes in relation \\nto the acquisition of Clifford Contracting which took \\nplace in June 2009. This acquisition provided a form  \\nof finance against unsold properties and would have \\nbeen available until 30 September 2011. The rate of \\nsales being secured resulted in the Board concluding \\nthat the funding was no longer required.

The Group has a supply-chain of partners \\nthat provide all the necessary design and building \\nservices to complete each development. The Group \\nhas established an ‘apprentice trainee’ strategy that  \\nis propagated through its supply-chain by delivering \\napprenticeships that provide a quality of training \\nsufficient to give each apprentice the opportunity for \\nlong term employment. Over the last five years the \\nGroup, along with its partners, has assisted over 30 \\nlocal apprentices to gain a valuable qualification  \\nwithin the construction industry. \\nThe Group also operates a comprehensive Management \\nTrainee programme under which trainees from school \\nor college are employed annually.

They are enrolled on college \\ncourses, funded by Telford Homes, for a minimum  \\nof four years with encouragement to progress to \\ncomplete a construction or surveying degree. A \\ncombination of college based training and on the  \\njob training alongside experienced staff allows the \\napprentices and trainees to develop technical as  \\nwell as personal skills. \\nWith a constant flow of new apprentices and trainees \\ndeveloping their skills and being promoted, Telford \\nHomes has developed a highly skilled workforce that  \\nis benefiting from updated industry knowledge \\ncombined with practical on the job training.\\nThe Group puts training at the heart of its  \\noperations ensuring its employees maintain their \\nindustry knowledge.

The committee makes recommendations to the Board on executive directors’ service agreements and \\nremuneration. In doing so it has undertaken relevant research to ensure that remuneration levels are competitive \\nwith the industry average. The committee met four times during the year.\\nr emuneration policy\\nIt is the Group’s policy to provide remuneration packages sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of \\nthe quality required. To add further incentive the directors have adopted two bonus schemes, one applicable \\nto all staff and a scheme for executive directors and senior management. Both schemes are dependent on the \\nGroup meeting certain financial performance targets. The maximum amount that can be earned under the \\nexecutive bonus scheme is 100% of basic salary.\\nThe Company operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) in which all employees are entitled to participate. The SIP exists in \\norder to increase employee ownership of shares and further details are given in note 17 to the financial statements.\\nDuring 2006 the Company set up a Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan (DPSPP) for the benefit of selected \\nsenior employees. Further details are given in note 17 to the financial statements. The remuneration committee \\nis responsible for approving any offers of shares made under the DPSPP. \\nThe Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors after considering external \\nmarket research. They do not participate in the bonus schemes or in the personal pension scheme. They are \\nentitled to participate in the SIP. \\nService contracts\\nThe executive directors have service contracts that can be terminated on twelve months notice.

AR11 back AW02.indd   47 13/06/2011   10:50 TEl FORD h OMES Plc  Annual Report & Accounts \\nfor the year ending 31 March 2011\\nFinancial Statements\\n48\\nStatement of accounting policies\\n31 March 2011\\nBasis of preparation\\nThe financial statements have been prepared in \\naccordance with International Financial Reporting \\nStandards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union \\nand IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of \\nthe Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies \\nreporting under IFRS. \\nThe financial statements have been prepared under \\nthe historical cost convention.\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity \\nwith generally accepted accounting principles requires \\nthe use of estimates and assumptions that affect the \\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date \\nof the financial statements and the reported amounts \\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting \\nperiod. Although these estimates are based on the \\ndirectors best knowledge of the amounts, events or \\nactions, actual results ultimately may differ from those \\nestimates. The most significant estimates made by \\nthe directors in these financial statements are set out \\nin 'Critical accounting judgements and key sources of \\nestimation uncertainty'.\\nThe accounting policies set out below have been \\napplied consistently for all periods presented in these \\nfinancial statements. \\nBasis of consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the \\nfinancial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries \\nand the Group's share of jointly controlled entities \\nup to 31 March 2011. The results of subsidiaries \\nacquired or disposed of during the year are included \\nin the financial statements from the effective date of \\nacquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as \\nappropriate. All intra-group transactions, balances, \\nincome and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\\nExemptions\\nThe directors have taken advantage of the exemption \\navailable under Section 408 of the Companies Act \\n2006 and have not presented an income statement for \\nthe Company alone.\\nJointly controlled entities\\nA jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the \\nGroup holds an interest with one or more other parties \\nwhere a contractual arrangement has established \\njoint control over the entity. Jointly controlled entities \\nare accounted for using proportional consolidation.\\nSegmental reporting\\nThe Group has only one business segment being \\nhousebuilding and one geographical segment being \\nthe United Kingdom. Financial analysis is presented on \\nthis basis to the chief operating decision makers for \\nthe Group these being the board of directors. \\nRevenue and profit recognition\\nProperties for open market sale\\nRevenue and profit is recognised at the point of legal \\ncompletion of each property.\\nCommission received on property sales made on \\nbehalf of third parties is recorded within revenue, with \\nall costs associated with the sale of those properties \\nrecognised within selling expenses.\\nConstruction contracts\\nContracts are treated as construction contracts \\nwhen they have been specifically negotiated for \\nthe construction of a development or a number of \\nproperties. These contracts are primarily for the \\nconstruction of affordable homes. Revenue is only \\nrecognised on a construction contract where the \\noutcome can be estimated reliably. Revenue and \\ncosts are recognised by reference to the stage of \\ncompletion of contract activity at the balance sheet \\ndate. This is normally measured by an assessment of \\nwork performed to date.\\nWhere the outcome of a construction contract cannot \\nbe estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised \\nto the extent of contract costs incurred that it is \\nprobable will be recoverable. When it is probable that \\ntotal contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, \\nthe expected loss is recognised as an expense \\nimmediately.\\nGrant income\\nGrants received from the Homes and Communities \\nAgency are recognised as revenue in the income \\nstatement to match with the related costs that they \\nare intended to compensate.\\nSelling expenses\\nSelling expenses are charged to the income statement \\nas incurred.\\nTEF2681 - AR11 back AW02.indd   48 13/06/2011   10:50 www.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\nFinancial Statements\\n49\\nBorrowings\\nInterest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are \\nrecorded at the proceeds received.\\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the \\ndevelopment of properties that take a substantial \\nperiod of time to get ready for sale, are capitalised \\nwithin inventories. Capitalisation of borrowing costs \\ncommences from the date of initial expenditure on a \\ngiven development and continues until the properties \\nare ready for sale. \\nThe capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended \\nwhere land assets are being held for strategic \\npurposes or where there are prolonged periods \\nwhen development activity on a site is interrupted. \\nCapitalisation is not normally suspended during a \\nperiod when substantial technical and administrative \\nwork is being carried out.\\nAll other borrowing costs are charged to the income \\nstatement using the effective interest method.\\nExceptional items\\nExceptional items are those significant items which \\nare separately disclosed by virtue of their size or \\nincidence to enable a full understanding of the Group's \\nfinancial performance.\\nFinance leases and hire purchase contracts\\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the \\nterms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks \\nand rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other \\nleases are classified as operating leases.\\nAssets held under finance leases and hire purchase \\ncontracts are recognised as assets of the Group at \\ntheir fair value or, if lower, at the present value of \\nthe minimum lease payments, each determined at \\nthe inception of the lease and depreciated over the \\nshorter of their expected useful lives and the lease \\nterm. The corresponding liability is included in the \\nbalance sheet as a finance lease or hire purchase \\nobligation. Lease payments are apportioned between \\nfinance charges and reduction of the lease obligations \\nso as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the \\nremaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are \\ncharged to the income statement.\\nOperating leases\\nOperating lease rentals are charged to the income \\nstatement on a straight line basis over the life of \\nthe lease.\\nPension costs\\nContributions paid to group personal pension schemes \\n(defined contribution), in respect of employees, are \\ncharged to the income statement as incurred.\\nProperty, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less \\naccumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on \\na straight line basis at rates calculated to write down \\nthe cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset \\nover its expected useful life as follows:\\nLeasehold improvements – shorter of term of lease  \\n and 10 years\\nPlant and machinery – 2 to 5 years\\nMotor vehicles – 3 years\\nInvestments\\nInterests in subsidiary undertakings and jointly \\ncontrolled entities are valued at cost less impairment. \\nInventories\\nDevelopment properties are included in inventories \\nand are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable \\nvalue. Cost comprises costs of acquisition and \\ndevelopment, including directly attributable fees and \\nexpenses, direct labour costs and borrowing costs. \\nIncluded within development properties are freehold \\ninterests held in completed developments. These are \\nheld for future sale. \\nFinancial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised \\non the Group's balance sheet when the Group becomes \\na party to the contractual provision of the instrument.\\nTrade receivables and other receivables\\nTrade receivables on normal terms do not carry \\nany interest and are stated at their nominal value \\nreduced by appropriate allowances for estimated \\nunrecoverable amounts.\\nCash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents are defined as cash \\nbalances in hand and in the bank (including short-term \\ncash deposits) which mature within three months or \\nless from the date of acquisition.\\nBorrowings\\nInterest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are \\nrecorded at the proceeds received. \\nTEF2681 - AR11 back AW02.indd   49 13/06/2011   10:50 TEl FORD h OMES Plc  Annual Report & Accounts \\nfor the year ending 31 March 2011\\nFinancial Statements\\n50\\nStatement of accounting policies\\n31 March 2011\\nFinancial instruments continued\\nTrade payables\\nTrade payables on normal terms are not interest \\nbearing and are stated at their nominal value.\\nl and creditors\\nWhen land is purchased on extended payment terms, \\nthe Group initially records it at its fair value with a land \\ncreditor recorded for any outstanding monies based \\non this fair value assessment. Fair value is determined \\nby using the effective interest method. The difference \\nbetween the nominal value and the initial fair value is \\namortised over the period of the extended credit term \\nand charged to finance costs, increasing the value of \\nthe land creditor so that at the date of maturity, the \\nland creditor equals the payment required.\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are \\nclassified according to the substance of the \\ncontractual arrangements entered into. An equity \\ninstrument is any contract that evidences a residual \\ninterest in the assets of the Group after deducting  \\nall of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the \\nGroup are recorded at the proceeds received, net  \\nof direct issue costs.\\nCurrent assets and liabilities\\nAssets that are expected to be realised in, or are \\nintended for sale or consumption in, the Group's \\nnormal operating cycle are treated as current even \\nto the extent these are expected to be realised after \\ntwelve months from the balance sheet date. Liabilities \\nthat are expected to be settled in the Group's normal \\noperating cycle are treated as current even though \\nthese may be due for settlement after twelve months \\nfrom the balance sheet date.\\nContingent liabilities\\nDisclosures are made for each class of contingent \\nliabilities at the balance sheet date detailing, where \\npracticable, an estimate of its financial effect and an \\nindication of uncertainties associated with the timing \\nor amount of the outflow, unless the possibility of a \\nfinancial outflow is remote.\\nTaxation\\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the tax \\ncurrently payable and deferred tax.\\nThe tax currently payable is based on the profits for the \\nyear. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported \\nin the income statement because it excludes items \\nof income or expense that are tax deductible in other \\nyears and it further excludes items that are never \\ntaxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current \\ntax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted \\nor substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary \\ndifferences that have originated but not reversed at \\nthe balance sheet date where transactions or events \\nthat result in an obligation to pay more tax in the \\nfuture or a right to pay less tax in the future have \\noccurred at the balance sheet date.\\nA net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable \\nand therefore recognised only when, on the basis  \\nof all available evidence, it can be regarded as more \\nlikely than not that there will be suitable taxable \\nprofits from which the future reversal of the  \\nunderlying timing differences can be deducted.\\nDeferred tax is charged or credited in the income \\nstatement, except when it relates to items charged or \\ncredited directly to equity, in which case the deferred \\ntax is also dealt with in equity.\\nShare-based payments\\nIn accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of equity \\nsettled share options granted is recognised as an \\nemployee expense with a corresponding increase in \\nequity. The fair value is measured as at the date the \\noptions are granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton \\npricing model and is charged equally over the vesting \\nperiod. The amount recognised as an expense is \\nadjusted each reporting period to reflect the actual \\nnumber of options that are expected to vest.\\nWith respect to share-based payments, a deferred \\ntax asset is recognised on the relevant tax base. The \\ntax base is then compared to the cumulative share-\\nbased payment expense recognised in the income \\nstatement. Deferred tax arising on the excess of the \\ntax base over the cumulative share-based payment \\nexpense recognised in the income statement has \\nbeen recognised directly in equity.\\nOwn shares\\nShares held by employee benefit trusts in order  \\nto satisfy awards under the Group's share plans  \\nare included net within equity until such time as \\nthe shares are vested to the relevant employees.\\nCritical accounting judgements and \\nkey sources of estimation uncertainty\\nConstruction contract revenue and  \\nprofit recognition\\nContract revenue is recognised from the date \\nof exchange of construction contracts at a rate \\nequivalent to the value of work undertaken in respect \\nof land development. Contract profit on construction \\nTEF2681 - AR11 back AW02.indd   50 13/06/2011   10:50 www.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\nFinancial Statements\\n51\\ncontracts is recognised in proportion to revenue only \\nto the extent that the total eventual profit on the \\ncontract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty.\\nAssessing the percentage complete on each contract \\ninvolves estimation of total expected costs to be \\nincurred until the end of the contract. Recognition of \\nprofit also involves estimation of the total expected \\nrevenues from each contract and therefore the expected \\nprofit margin that will be achieved. Judgement is \\nrequired to assess whether the total eventual profit on \\neach contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty.\\nCarrying value of land and work in progress\\nInventories include land and work in progress in \\nrespect of development sites. On each development \\njudgement is required to assess whether the cost of \\nland and any associated work in progress is in excess \\nof its net realisable value.\\nRecent accounting developments\\nDuring the year IAS 27 (revised), IFRS 3 (revised) \\nand amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 32 have become \\neffective and have been adopted by the Group. In \\naddition IFRIC 17 and IFRIC 18 have become effective \\nfor the Group. Adoption of the new and revised \\nstandards and interpretations has not had any \\nsignificant impact on the amounts reported in these \\nfinancial statements.\\nAmendments to IFRS 2, IAS 17 and IAS 39 were made \\nas part of Annual improvements to IFRSs 2009. Their \\nadoption has not had any significant impact on the \\namounts reported in these financial statements but \\nmay impact the accounting for future transactions \\nand arrangements.\\nAt the date of the authorisation of these financial \\nstatements, there are a number of standards, \\namendments and interpretations that have been \\npublished but are not yet effective.\\nThe standards, amendments and interpretations that \\nare expected to impact upon the Group are:\\n y Annual improvements 2010 is a collection of \\namendments to a number of standards as part \\nof the IASB programme of making non-urgent but \\nnecessary amendments to IFRSs.

This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and confers certain tax \\nadvantages for participating employees.\\nThe SIP provides for employees to purchase shares up to a value of £1,500 in each tax year. These shares are \\nknown as ‘Partnership shares’. Partnership shares are matched on a one for one basis by ‘Matching shares’ \\nprovided by the Group subject to the shares remaining in the SIP for a period not less than three years. Dividends \\nare paid on both Partnership and Matching shares and these are allocated to employees as ‘Dividend shares’.\\nThe Group has set up a trust to administer the SIP and to hold shares on behalf of individual employees. This trust \\nis an entirely separate entity to the Group and is managed by a corporate trustee, Telford Homes Trustees Limited. \\nThe costs associated with the trust are paid for by the Group and the Group finances all share purchases.\\nThe trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating in the \\nscheme.

An employee benefit trust (the Telford Homes Plc 2006 Employee \\nBenefit Trust) was set up with Abacus Corporate Trustee Limited acting as trustee.\\nParticipants in the DPSPP are offered a loan by the trustee to enable them to subscribe for a specified number of \\nshares in the Group at market value. This loan is interest free repayable on or before the repayment date which \\nis normally 20 years from the date of the loan or on disposing of the shares. The loan has a limited recourse \\nsuch that repayment is limited to the value of the shares on the repayment date. The Group will lend the trustee \\nsufficient funds to enable the trustee to provide the loans to individual participants. All shares acquired under \\nthe DPSPP will be subject to a three year vesting period and are held by the trustee for the benefit of the \\nparticipants. Offers to participants will be made periodically at the discretion of the directors of Telford Homes \\nPlc.\\nIn September 2006 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 550,000 shares at the market \\nvalue of 260p. These shares were issued on 9 November 2006. On this date the Group provided a loan to the \\ntrustee of £1,430,000 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. This loan is repayable \\nat the earlier of the sale of the vested shares and November 2026 and has been recognised as a deduction from \\nshareholders’ funds in the statement of changes in equity.\\nIn December 2007 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 160,000 shares at the market \\nvalue of 244p. These shares were issued on 14 December 2007. On this date the Group provided a loan to the \\ntrustee of £390,400 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants.

At \\n31\\xa0March\\xa02011 Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited had utilised £34.0 million of this facility leaving an unutilised \\nbalance of £23.7 million. Interest is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% on the majority of the facility. \\nIncluded within the £57.7 million is a mezzanine loan facility of £8.0 million and interest on this loan is charged at \\nLIBOR plus a margin of 5%.\\nIn addition the Group’s jointly controlled entity, Bishopsgate Apartments LLP, has a loan facility with Allied Irish \\nBank of £15.0 million in respect of the purchase of development land in Bethnal Green Road. At 31\\xa0March\\xa02011 \\nBishopsgate Apartments LLP had utilised all £15.0 million of this facility. The Group has recorded its 50% share of \\nthe loan in its balance sheet at 31 March 2011. Interest is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of 4.5%. This facility is due \\nfor repayment on 14 December 2011.\\nMarket risk     \\nThe Group is exposed to the financial risk of changes in interest rates both in terms of changes in the base rate \\nand LIBOR and in terms of individual banks attitude to market risk and their application of either base rate or \\nLIBOR to new facilities and the margin applied to each new facility.\\nIn order to assess the risk interest costs are forecast on a monthly basis over a five year period using estimates \\nof likely changes in rates and actual costs are compared to this forecast. Volatility of interest costs remained at \\nan acceptable level in the year ended 31 March 2011 as LIBOR remains at a historically low level. Interest on all \\nfacilities currently held is charged at floating interest rates and the Group assesses the requirement for fixing \\ninterest rates on a regular basis. \\nThe effect on the income statement of a 1% rise and a 1% fall in interest rates has been calculated to assess interest \\nrate sensitivity. Based on average monthly borrowings in the year, a 1% rise in interest rates would have a negative \\neffect of £504,000 before tax (2010: £845,000), a 1% fall in interest rates gives the same but opposite effect.\\nCapital risk\\nThe Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going \\nconcern in order to provide returns for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining \\nan appropriate capital structure to reduce the costs of capital. The Group considers its capital to be all of the \\ncomponents of net assets.\\nThe Group ensures that there are appropriate controls over the purchase of land and levels of work in progress in \\nthe business in order to appropriately manage its capital. In addition, the other methods by which the Group can \\nmanage its short-term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the level of ordinary dividends paid to \\nshareholders, issuing new share capital and arranging debt.\\nCredit risk\\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.\\nTrade and other receivables includes amounts recoverable on contracts which are due from housing associations \\nand balances due from other Group undertakings. The Group considers the credit quality of the various debtors \\nto be good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low. \\nSurplus cash is held in secure bank deposit accounts with Allied Irish Bank, The Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, \\nHSBC, Barclays Bank and Investec Bank plc. \\nTEF2681 - AR11 back AW02.indd   69 13/06/2011   10:50 TEl FORD h OMES Plc  Annual Report & Accounts \\nfor the year ending 31 March 2011\\nFinancial Statements\\nNotes to the financial statements\\n31 March 2011\\n70\\n20 Financial instruments continued\\nl iquidity risk\\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they \\nfall due.\\nThe Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows over a five year \\nperiod and performing sensitivity analysis on these forecasts. The forecasts are necessarily subject to a number \\nof assumptions and judgements and these are tested on a reasonable basis by the sensitivity analysis. These \\nforecasts and the related sensitivity analysis are reviewed by the directors in detail on a monthly basis. In addition \\nall of the forecasts and supporting calculations are made available to each bank funding the Group on a monthly \\nbasis. The current forecasts show positive cash balances beyond the next twelve months even where this is \\nsubjected to sensitivity testing. \\nThe Group utilises bank facilities to ensure that adequate funding is available to cover working capital \\nrequirements and the directors consider that existing facilities are sufficient to cover funding requirements in the \\nforeseeable future both where these have already been utilised and where they are currently unutilised. Where \\nfacilities are due to expire within one year this is due to the timing of the relevant developments and therefore \\nthe expected repayment dates. In all of these cases the directors are satisfied that the loans are expected to be \\nrepaid by the date the facility expires.\\nThe Group’s bank facilities are subject to a number of general and financial covenants which are tested \\nperiodically by each bank. In all cases the directors have assessed whether the Group will remain in compliance \\nwith the covenants for at least twelve months after signing the financial statements and are satisfied that there \\nwill be no breach of the covenants. \\nThe maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows based on the earliest date on which the Group can be \\nrequired to pay financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis (including future interest payments using the latest \\napplicable rates) is as follows:\\nTrade \\npayables\\n£000\\nl and\\ncreditors\\n£000\\nBorrowings\\n £000\\n hire purchase\\nliabilities\\n£000\\nTotal\\n£000\\nWithin one year 7,610 – 20,311 16 27,937\\nMore than one year \\nand less than two years\\n– – 6,147 19 6,166\\nMore than two years \\nand less than five years\\n– – 45,615 – 45,615\\n31 March 2011 7,610 – 72,073 35 79,718\\nTrade \\npayables\\n£000\\nl and\\ncreditors\\n£000\\nBorrowings\\n £000\\n hire purchase\\nliabilities\\n£000\\nTotal\\n£000\\nWithin one year 5,835 88 13,280 – 19,203\\nMore than one year \\nand less than two years\\n– – 47,674 – 47,674\\nMore than two years \\nand less than five years\\n– – 13,485 – 13,485\\n31 March 2010 5,835 88 74,439 – 80,362\\nTEF2681 - AR11 back AW02.indd   70 13/06/2011   10:50 www.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\nFinancial Statements\\n71\\n21 Business combination\\nOn 17 September 2010, the Group acquired 50% of the issued share capital of Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited, \\na property development company currently developing land in Greenwich, London. Following the acquisition, the \\nGroup owns 100% of the ordinary shares of Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited and has sole control of the company. \\nThe book value and fair value of the assets and liabilities of Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited at the date of \\nacquisition are set out below:\\nBook and\\n fair value\\n£000\\n50%\\nacquired\\n£000\\nInventories 58,716 29,358\\nCash 2,414 1,207\\nTrade and other payables (28,102) (14,051)\\nBorrowings (32,006) (16,003)\\nNet assets 1,022 511\\nThe total consideration paid for 50% of the ordinary shares in issue was £500 in cash. As a result, the Group \\nrecognised a ‘bargain gain’ of £510,500 representing 50% of the fair value of the net assets of Telford Homes \\n(Creekside) Limited on 17 September 2010 less the £500 purchase price. This gain is included in exceptional items \\nin the results to 31 March 2011. The assets and liabilities acquired all relate to the company’s site in Greenwich and \\nwill be realised as the development is completed over the next two years.\\nThere was no difference between the fair value and the book value of the assets and liabilities of Telford Homes \\n(Creekside) Limited at the date of acquisition and therefore no gain or loss arose on the existing shareholding.\\nThis acquisition contributed additional revenue of £9.7 million and profit before tax of £0.9\\xa0million to the Group  \\nfor the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date. Had the acquisition occurred on  \\n1 April 2010, the consolidated income statement would have included additional revenue of £11.1 million and \\nprofit before tax of £0.8 million. \\nAcquisition related costs amounting to £2,000 are included in administrative costs in the Group income statement.\\n22 Repurchase and cancellation of shares\\nOn 30 September 2010 the Company repaid all outstanding loan notes in relation to the acquisition of Clifford \\nContracting Limited which took place on 23 June 2009. This final repayment amounted to £4.3 million.\\nAs a result of the loan notes being repaid the Company immediately exercised its option to repurchase  \\n1,130,089 ordinary shares from the vendors of Clifford Contracting Limited for a total sum of £1.

The housing market in London has \\nremained robust, particularly relative to the rest \\nof the country, and the Group’s activities are \\nfocused on some of the more successful locations \\nwithin this market.\\nThe Group’s open market customers are split \\nbetween UK buyers, both owner-occupiers and \\ninvestors, and a continuing level of investment \\ndemand from overseas buyers.\\nTelford Homes’ land buying strategy ensures \\nthat sites purchased are attractive to the Group’s \\ntarget markets and in locations where we expect \\nsufficient finance to be available for buyers to \\npurchase the homes. The overseas launch of  \\nThe Panoramic, just north of Canary Wharf, \\nearlier this month proves there is demand in the \\nFar East for the right product in the right location \\nwith 44 of the 90 open market homes already sold.\\nThe Group has reached the end of the two year \\nperiod during which the Board anticipated profits \\nat lower levels, due to the longer term effects of \\nthe housing downturn in 2008 and 2009, and \\nTelford Homes is now in a strong position with \\navailable finance as well as a healthy development \\npipeline. This enables the Board to be confident \\nin forecasting a significant increase in profit for \\nthe year to 31 March 2013 and continued growth \\nbeyond that.\\nThe Board has reaffirmed its intention to pay a \\nprogressive dividend year-on-year and as such \\nthe final dividend proposed is 1.5 pence making a \\ntotal of 3.0 pence for the year (2011: 2.5 pence). \\nLooking forward the Board expects to pay around \\na third of its future earnings in dividends.\\nAfter ten years as Non-Executive Chairman  \\nDavid Holland has moved aside for me but  \\nwill continue to contribute as our senior  \\nNon-Executive Director.

As in previous years a significant \\nproportion of these sales have been achieved \\nahead of build completion and there are now \\nmore than 400 pre-sold open market homes  \\nthat will contribute to profit in the new financial \\nyear and beyond.\\nOpen market completions\\nThe number of open market properties legally \\ncompleted in the year to 31 March 2012 \\nincreased to 314 (2011: 281). This was ahead of \\nthe Board’s expectations mainly due to strong \\nsales of finished homes in the last six months \\nof the year. For the last two years the Group has \\nbeen delivering a lower proportion of open market \\nhomes and has been achieving lower than normal \\nmargins due to the change in strategy required to \\nprotect the business during the downturn in the \\nhousing market.\\nThe Board targeted margin improvement during \\nthe year and gross and operating profit margins \\nare now moving in the right direction. The gross \\nmargin before interest charges and exceptional \\nitems has increased to 17.6 per cent (2011:  \\n15.1 per cent) and the operating margin before \\ninterest charges and exceptional items has \\nincreased to 6.2 per cent (2011: 5.2 per cent).  \\nAs a result of higher than expected sales and \\nmargin improvements, the Group has reported \\nprofit before tax and exceptional items up  \\n20 per cent at £3.0 million (2011: £2.5 million).\\nAll of the developments with a greater proportion \\nof affordable housing than usual, and the open \\nmarket homes achieving lower than expected \\nsales prices as a result of the last recession, \\nhave now been substantially completed. As such \\nit is anticipated that there will be an increased \\nnumber of open market completions in the new \\nfinancial year and that margins will return to more \\nnormal levels. In addition, of the open market \\nhomes expected to be handed over to customers \\nin the year to 31 March 2013 over 65 per cent \\nhave already been sold. The Board has previously \\nstated that it expects to report a substantial \\nincrease in pre-tax profits for the year to  \\n31 March 2013 and this remains the case.\\nl ondon housing market\\nThe London housing market has continued \\nto outperform the rest of the country and its \\nfundamental strengths, in terms of being a  \\nmajor international centre for finance and \\nbusiness with a growing population and a lack \\nof supply of new homes, suggest this is likely to \\ncontinue. Not only is the population growing but \\nprojections from the Office of National Statistics \\nindicate that 70 per cent of household growth in \\nthe next decade will be formed by single person \\nhouseholds. The Mayor’s London Plan predicts \\nthat more than 30,000 new homes are required \\nacross the capital each year for the next  \\n20 years. The number of new build starts \\nin London, recorded by the Department for \\nCommunities and Local Government, has been \\nconsistently below this and less than half of the \\nrequired number for the last four years.\\n“ The Board has previously stated  \\nthat it expects to report a substantial \\nincrease in pre-tax profits for the year \\nto 31 March 2013 and this remains \\nthe case.”\\nJon Di-Stefano, Chief Executive tel FORD h OmeS Plc  \\nAnnual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2012 12\\nReview of the Year\\nWhilst some commentators question these \\ndynamics of supply and demand it is clear that, \\nregardless of the inability of some purchasers to \\naccess mortgage finance, there is an increasing \\nrental demand that is not being satisfied. As a \\nresult, rents in some parts of London rose by \\nmore than 10 per cent in 2011.\\nOpen market sales\\nWhere possible the Group will sell open market \\nhomes early in the development cycle, typically \\nto investors. These investors are predominantly \\nbased overseas but there has also been demand \\nfrom UK buyers, all of whom are attracted by \\nrental yields of around six per cent.\\nIn April and May of 2011 the Group secured \\n186 sales at Avant-garde, E1 its joint venture \\ndevelopment with The William Pears Group. Of \\nthese 62 were to UK buyers. Subsequently some \\nsmaller developments have secured sales in the \\nFar East followed more recently by the launch of \\nThe Panoramic in Poplar, E14 which took place \\nin Hong Kong and Singapore earlier this month. \\nThe Panoramic is a striking 20 storey tower in a \\nstrong location just to the north of Canary Wharf \\nand, as a result, 44 of the 90 open market homes \\nhave already been sold. Completions are due in \\nlate 2013. Selling nearly half of this development \\nat this stage is a great achievement given current \\neconomic concerns across Europe and confirms \\nthat London is still regarded as a safe haven for \\noverseas investment.\\nAlongside these successful overseas marketing \\ncampaigns a significant proportion of the  \\nGroup’s sales remain in the UK and particularly  \\nto owner-occupiers. Over 50 per cent of the  \\nopen market homes completed in the year to \\n31 March 2012 were sold to UK buyers. There \\nhave been strong sales recorded across all \\nof the Group’s developments during the year, \\nparticularly at Bow Trinity, E3, Greenwich \\nCreekside, SE8 and Matchmakers Wharf, E9 \\namongst others. All nine homes, including \\ndetached houses, at Wingfield Mews in Hendon \\nhave been sold and completed in the year and  \\nat High Cedars in Wanstead 15 out of 24 homes \\nare already sold three to four months ahead of \\nbuild completion. Additionally, there is now just \\none finished apartment left for sale at Queen \\nMary’s Gate in Woodford compared to 70 at  \\nthe start of the financial year.\\nTight mortgage availability restricts demand \\nfrom potential owner-occupiers and particularly \\nfirst time buyers. Although there was some \\nimprovement in the last year, mortgage lending \\nis still at very low levels and whilst this is \\nunlikely to get much better in the short term, \\nit seems equally unlikely that the situation will \\nget any worse. Lenders continue to discriminate \\nagainst new build properties by requiring higher \\ndeposits. The new Government backed 95 per \\ncent mortgage product ‘NewBuy’ should  \\nassist some purchasers but the Group will \\nmonitor the level of success the scheme enjoys  \\nbefore deciding whether to join at a later date. \\nChIeF exe CUt IVe’S ReVIeW 13\\nReview of the Year\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\nHIGH CEDARS\\nWANSTEAD\\nComputer Generated Images tel FORD h OmeS Plc  \\nAnnual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2012 14\\nReview of the Year\\nChIeF exe CUt IVe’S ReVIeW\\nTHE PANORAMIC\\nE14\\nComputer Generated Images 15\\nReview of the Year\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\nThe Board has ensured that the Group’s land \\nacquisitions have been in locations that appeal \\nto owner-occupiers with greater levels of equity \\navailable, sometimes sourced from extended \\nfamily, and investors that are seeking a return  \\non their equity and are funding their purchases  \\nat lower loan to value ratios.\\nPartnerships and affordable housing\\nDespite a return to constructing a more normal \\nproportion of open market homes, affordable \\nhousing remains a significant and important  \\npart of the business. In the year to 31 March 2012 \\nthe Group completed 542 affordable homes, \\nhanding them over to its various partners, and \\nas a result has received the vast majority of its \\n2008–2011 grant allocation from the Homes  \\nand Communities Agency (HCA). The HCA in \\nLondon has now become part of the Greater \\nLondon Authority (GLA) and the Group has \\nsecured a grant allocation in the new 2011–2015 \\nprogramme which will primarily assist the  \\ndelivery of estate regeneration schemes  \\nexpected to commence in the next few months.\\nThe funding regime for affordable housing \\nunderwent significant change in the last year  \\nand this led to uncertainty in modelling the \\nexpected value of affordable homes for all \\nconcerned. As the sector has got to grips with \\nthe new regime, the Group has developed a clear \\nunderstanding of the value of affordable homes \\nto be delivered at various rent levels, including \\nthe new ‘affordable rent’ model where rents are \\ncharged at a proportion of market levels.  \\nIn assessing these values, the Group has forged \\nnew relationships with some major housing \\nassociations keen to embrace the new funding \\nmodel. This is an important aspect of remaining \\ncompetitive in land acquisitions.\\nl and acquisition\\nDuring 2011 the Board reviewed its land \\nacquisition strategy and as a result made some \\nsmall changes to the Group’s area of operation. \\nThe focus of the Group’s land buying remains \\npredominantly in East London but is now \\nconcentrated on the areas in and around the City \\nand Canary Wharf where demand is stronger and \\nless reliant on mortgage constrained buyers. \\nThese areas are also benefitting from transport \\nimprovements as a result of the Olympics, the \\n£16 billion investment in Crossrail and new \\nfacilities such as the Westfield shopping centre  \\nin Stratford.\\nAs a result of reducing the scope for acquisition \\nin the outer boroughs of East London, the Board \\nhas widened its focus into adjoining areas of \\nNorth and Central London where higher priced \\nproperties are in demand both from investors and \\nowner-occupiers. The Group has purchased its \\nfirst development site in Lambeth, near the Albert \\nEmbankment, to provide 101 homes in a new  \\n24 storey tower and also acquired its first site  \\nin the London Borough of Camden.\\nIt is highly likely that this change in focus will \\nincrease the average price of the properties being \\ndeveloped by the Group in the next few years.  \\nIn the year to 31 March 2012 the average price  \\nof the open market homes sold was £339,000,  \\na significant increase on £259,000 last year.  tel FORD h OmeS Plc  \\nAnnual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2012 16\\nReview of the Year\\nChIeF exe CUt IVe’S ReVIeW\\nAVANT-GARDE\\nE1 17\\nReview of the Year\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\nHowever this was heavily influenced by the  \\nsales achieved at Avant-garde which has a  \\nmuch higher price point and excluding this \\ndevelopment the average price of the  \\nremaining sales was £266,000.\\nIn total Telford Homes has agreed to acquire \\nnearly £50 million of new land opportunities since \\nsecuring a long term bank facility in March 2011. \\nAll of these acquisitions have been purchased \\non the basis of an appropriate expected profit \\nmargin and return on capital. The majority have a \\nfull planning consent or are contracted subject to \\nachieving a satisfactory consent and all of them \\nare on ‘brownfield’ land. The Group has, and \\nwill, purchase smaller sites without a planning \\nconsent where the risk of not achieving a consent \\nis assessed to be very low. Despite excellent \\nrelationships within the Group’s area of operation \\nthe planning environment remains challenging \\nand, whilst any attempts to improve this are \\nwelcome, it remains to be seen what impact the \\nnew ‘National Planning Policy Framework’ will \\nhave. Telford Homes has secured some significant \\nplanning consents in the last year, including \\nestate regeneration schemes, and these can only \\nbe achieved by continuous engagement with both \\nthe local authority and the local community.\\nThe development pipeline at 31 March 2012 \\nincluded 1,969 properties (2011: 1,904 \\nproperties) of which 1,949 have a detailed \\nplanning consent. This total includes sites under \\noption contracts within the control of the Group. \\nThere are 1,487 properties under construction \\nwith the remainder expected to commence \\nwithin the next year. As the business returns to a \\nmore normal mix of open market and affordable \\nhousing, the balance of the pipeline is changing. \\nThe number of open market homes has increased \\nto 1,677 compared to 1,338 last year. In total the \\ndevelopment pipeline is expected to deliver more \\nthan £100 million of gross profit over the next \\nfour years.\\nOperations\\nThe Board has always taken great pride in the \\nquality of construction undertaken by Telford \\nHomes and the level of customer service the \\nGroup provides. This year that quality was \\nrecognised with four NHBC ‘Pride in the Job’ \\nawards and Greenwich Creekside went on to \\nachieve the honour of winning the national \\nNHBC ‘Pride in the Job Supreme Award’ in \\nthe multi-storey category. In addition, for the \\nsecond successive year, more than 97 per cent \\nof the Group’s customers would recommend \\nTelford Homes to others and this demonstrates \\nboth the quality of the product and the service \\nthe customers receive at the point of sale, on \\nhandover and beyond.\\nComputer Generated Images tel FORD h OmeS Plc  \\nAnnual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2012 18\\nReview of the Year\\nChIeF exe CUt IVe’S ReVIeW\\nDespite the cost of changes in building \\nregulations and the Group’s own efforts to \\nremain as environmentally friendly as possible \\nthere have been some significant cost savings \\nidentified in the last year which are helping to \\nimprove margins both now and going forward. \\nIn addition the Health and Safety record of the \\nGroup was once again excellent this year with \\nonly a small number of accidents, well below  \\nthe industry average.\\nIt has been a year of some changes in terms of \\nthe Board of Telford Homes. I remain delighted \\nto have been given the chance to build on the \\ndecade of success already behind us and to  \\nhelp take the Group forward as Chief Executive. \\nI am particularly grateful to Andrew Wiseman for \\nproviding me the space to take on the challenge \\nbut equally I am pleased to have his support \\nand continuing guidance as Executive Chairman. \\nWe have also welcomed Katie Rogers and David \\nCampbell to the Board during the last year.

As a result of improving profit margins, \\nincreasing open market output and pre-sales \\nalready secured, a substantial increase in profit \\nbefore tax is expected in the year to 31 March 2013. \\nThe Group’s corporate banking facility has \\nenabled it to invest heavily in land in the year and \\ntogether with equity, this facility ensures that \\nTelford Homes has funding available to develop \\nexisting sites and invest in more land, facilitating \\nfurther growth in the future.\\nOperating results\\nRevenue increased to £124.4 million  \\n(2011: £121.1 million) with gross profit  \\nbefore exceptional items of £18.9 million  \\n(2011: £15.4 million). Gross profit is stated  \\nafter expensing loan interest that has been \\ncapitalised within inventories of £2.9 million \\n(2011: £2.9 million) and before charging this \\ninterest the gross margin in the year was  \\n17.6 per cent compared to 15.1 per cent  \\nlast year.\\nThe increase in revenue is due to a greater volume \\nof open market completions partially offset by \\na reduction in the level of affordable revenue. \\nDuring the recession, the Group switched a \\nnumber of developments to affordable housing \\nand as a result the output of the Group became \\nmore heavily weighted towards affordable homes \\nthan in pre-recession years. Most of the affected \\ndevelopments completed during the year to  \\n31 March 2012 and the Group expects to return \\nto a more normal output going forward as new \\nsites are acquired with a traditional mix of \\nhousing, usually around two thirds open market \\nand one third affordable.\\nThe improvement in gross profit margin is driven \\nby a greater proportion of the completions in  \\nthe year being at developments less affected  \\nby the housing downturn compared to the \\nprior year together with build cost savings. \\nThe operational teams continue to monitor \\nand control development costs with a focus on \\nidentifying cost savings wherever possible and \\nsignificant build cost savings have been achieved, \\nsome of which were recognised in the year to  \\n31 March 2012 with the remainder to be \\nrecognised in future years.\\nAdministrative expenses have increased to  \\n£10.6 million (2011: £9.3 million) essentially  \\ndue to higher employee costs. Employee  \\nnumbers have gradually risen over the last  \\n18 months, necessary to manage the growing \\nlevel of construction activity and resulting  \\nsupport services required, which in turn will  \\ndeliver higher output levels in the future. The year  \\nto 31 March 2012 was the busiest since Telford \\nHomes was formed with 1,769,707 man-hours \\nrecorded across the business compared to \\n1,456,837 in 2011. Additional employee and \\nadministrative costs were incurred in relation \\nto the set-up of the in-house legal department \\nrecruited in the year which reduces external  \\nlegal costs and will result in a net benefit to  \\nthe Group in future years.\\n“ Telford Homes has funding available \\nto develop existing sites and invest \\nin more land, facilitating further \\ngrowth in the future.”\\nFInan CIal R eVIeW\\nKatie Rogers, Financial Director 21\\nReview of the Year\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\nWINGFIELD MEWS\\nHENDON tel FORD h OmeS Plc  \\nAnnual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2012 22\\nReview of the Year\\nFInan CIal R eVIeW\\nGREENWICH \\nCREEKSIDE \\nSE8 23\\nReview of the Year\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\nSelling expenses have risen in the year from  \\n£2.7 million to £3.5 million broadly in line with \\nthe increase in contracts exchanged in the year. \\nA proportion of the selling expenses incurred in \\nthe year were in relation to successful launches \\nof new developments. These launches generated \\na significant number of pre-sales of homes \\nwhich are scheduled to complete, and therefore \\ndeliver profits, in future financial years. However \\nthe accounting treatment for selling expenses \\nis that they must be expensed as incurred even \\nthough profit recognition from any sales is when \\nthe property legally completes, which can be a \\nnumber of years later.\\nDespite this, the operating margin before \\nexceptional items and interest increased to \\n6.2 per cent compared to 5.2 per cent for the \\nyear ended 31 March 2011.

Although the \\nBoard does not believe significant rate rises are \\nlikely in the near future the cost of interest rate \\nprotection has been quite low for the same reason \\nand as such it is worth investing a small amount \\nto protect the business and ensure that interest \\ncover covenants remain achievable. The interest \\nrate caps are individually fair valued at each \\nperiod end with any movement in the value being \\ncharged or credited to the income statement and \\nthis has resulted in some hedging costs in the \\nyear to 31 March 2012.\\nThe Board believes the security of having  \\nlonger term bank funding outweighs the \\nincreased finance costs in the year and considers \\nthe rates being charged are competitive in the \\ncurrent market. tel FORD h OmeS Plc  \\nAnnual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2012 24\\nReview of the Year\\nFInan CIal R eVIeW\\nDividend\\nThe Board has proposed a final dividend of  \\n1.5 pence which, together with the 1.5 pence \\ninterim dividend paid on 13 January 2012,  \\nmakes a total dividend for the year of 3.0 pence,  \\na 20 per cent increase compared to the prior  \\nyear (2011: 2.5 pence).

Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with \\napplicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us  \\nto comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.\\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a  \\nbody in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We  \\ndo not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other \\nperson to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by  \\nour prior consent in writing.\\nscope of the audit of the financial statements\\nAn audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements \\nsufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, \\nwhether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies \\nare appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately \\ndisclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the \\noverall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial \\ninformation in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. \\nIf we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the \\nimplications for our report.\\no pinion on financial statements \\nIn our opinion: \\n•\\t t h e\\tf i n a n c i a l\\t s t a t e

ended 31 March 2012 52\\nst Ateme Nt of A ccou Nti NG policies 31 MARCh 2012\\nBasis of preparation\\nThe financial statements have been prepared in \\naccordance with applicable International Financial \\nReporting Standards (IFRS) including International \\nAccounting Standards (IAS) and International \\nFinancial Reporting Interpretations Committee \\n(IFRIC) interpretations as adopted for use in \\nthe European Union and with those parts of the \\nCompanies Act 2006 applicable to companies \\nreporting under IFRS. \\nThe financial statements have been prepared \\nunder the historical cost convention as modified for \\nreassessment of derivatives at fair value and on a \\ngoing concern basis.\\nThe preparation of financial statements in \\nconformity with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples requires the use of estimates and \\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of \\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial \\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues \\nand expenses during the reporting period. Although \\nthese estimates are based on the directors best \\nknowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual \\nresults ultimately may differ from those estimates. \\nThe most significant estimates made by the \\ndirectors in these financial statements are set out  \\nin ‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources \\nof estimation uncertainty’.\\nThe accounting policies set out below have been \\napplied consistently for all periods presented in \\nthese financial statements. \\nBasis of consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include \\nthe financial statements of the Company, its \\nsubsidiaries and the Group’s share of jointly \\ncontrolled entities up to 31 March 2012. The results \\nof subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the \\nyear are included in the financial statements from \\nthe effective date of acquisition or up to the effective \\ndate of disposal, as appropriate. All intra-group \\ntransactions, balances, income and expenses are \\neliminated on consolidation.\\nexemptions\\nThe directors have taken advantage of the exemption \\navailable under Section 408 of the Companies Act \\n2006 and have not presented an income statement \\nor statement of comprehensive income for the \\nCompany alone.\\nJointly controlled entities\\nA jointly controlled entity is an entity in which \\nthe Group holds an interest with one or more \\nother parties where a contractual arrangement \\nhas established joint control over the entity. \\nJointly controlled entities are accounted for using \\nproportional consolidation.\\nsegmental reporting\\nThe Group has only one business segment being \\nhousebuilding and one geographical segment being \\nthe United Kingdom. Financial analysis is presented \\non this basis to the chief operating decision makers \\nfor the Group these being the board of directors. \\nr evenue and profit recognition\\nProperties for open market sale\\nRevenue and profit is recognised at the point of legal \\ncompletion of each property.\\nConstruction contracts\\nContracts are treated as construction contracts \\nwhen they have been specifically negotiated for \\nthe construction of a development or a number of \\nproperties. These contracts are primarily for the \\nconstruction of affordable homes sold to affordable \\nhousing providers. Revenue is only recognised \\non a construction contract where the outcome \\ncan be estimated reliably. Revenue and costs are \\nrecognised by reference to the stage of completion \\nof contract activity at the balance sheet date. This \\nis normally measured by an assessment of work \\nperformed to date on a cost basis.\\nWhere the outcome of a construction contract \\ncannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is \\nrecognised to the extent of contract costs incurred \\nthat it is probable will be recoverable. When it is \\nprobable that total contract costs will exceed total \\ncontract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as \\nan expense immediately.\\nOn the balance sheet, the Group reports the net \\ncontract position for each contract either as an \\nasset or liability. A contract represents an asset \\nwhere costs incurred plus recognised profits exceed \\nprogress billing and a contract represents a liability \\nwhere the opposite is the case. These are disclosed \\nas amounts recoverable on contracts.\\nGrant income\\nGrants received from the Greater London Authority \\n(formerly the homes and Communities Agency) are \\nrecognised as revenue in the income statement to \\nmatch with the related costs that they are intended \\nto compensate.\\nselling expenses\\nSelling expenses are charged to the income \\nstatement as incurred.\\nBorrowings\\nInterest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are \\ninitially measured at fair value, being proceeds \\nreceived net of transaction costs and are \\nsubsequently measured at amortised cost,  \\nusing the effective interest rate method.  Financial Statements\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk 53\\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the \\ndevelopment of properties that take a substantial \\nperiod of time to get ready for sale, are capitalised \\nwithin inventories. Capitalisation of borrowing costs \\ncommences from the date of initial expenditure \\non a given development and continues until the \\nproperties are ready for sale. \\nThe capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended \\nwhere land assets are being held for strategic \\npurposes or where there are prolonged periods \\nwhen development activity on a site is interrupted. \\nCapitalisation is not normally suspended during a \\nperiod when substantial technical and administrative \\nwork is being carried out.\\nAll other borrowing costs are charged to the income \\nstatement using the effective interest method. \\nBorrowing costs paid are classified as operating \\nactivities in the cash flow statement. \\ninterest rate cap assets\\nInterest rate caps are individually valued at each \\nperiod end and adjusted to ensure that they are held \\nat fair value. Any change in the fair value is charged or \\ncredited to the income statement within finance costs.\\nexceptional items\\nExceptional items are those significant items which \\nare separately disclosed by virtue of their size or \\nincidence to enable a full understanding of the \\nGroup’s financial performance.\\nf inance leases and hire purchase contracts\\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the \\nterms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks \\nand rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other \\nleases are classified as operating leases.\\nAssets held under finance leases and hire purchase \\ncontracts are recognised as assets of the Group at \\ntheir fair value or, if lower, at the present value of \\nthe minimum lease payments, each determined at \\nthe inception of the lease and depreciated over the \\nshorter of their expected useful lives and the lease \\nterm. The corresponding liability is included in the \\nbalance sheet as a finance lease or hire purchase \\nobligation. Lease payments are apportioned between \\nfinance charges and reduction of the lease obligations \\nso as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the \\nremaining balance of the liability. Finance charges  \\nare charged to the income statement.\\no perating leases\\nOperating lease rentals are charged to the income \\nstatement on a straight line basis over the life of \\nthe lease.\\npension costs\\nContributions paid to group personal pension \\nschemes (defined contribution), in respect of \\nemployees, are charged to the income statement  \\nas incurred.\\nproperty, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less \\naccumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided \\non a straight line basis at rates calculated to write \\ndown the cost, less estimated residual value, of each \\nasset over its expected useful life as follows:\\nLeasehold improvements – shorter of term of lease  \\n  and 10 years\\nPlant and machinery – 2 to 5 years\\nMotor vehicles – 3 years\\ninvestments\\nInterests in subsidiary undertakings and jointly \\ncontrolled entities are valued at cost less impairment.\\ninventories\\nDevelopment properties are included in inventories \\nand are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable \\nvalue. Cost comprises costs of acquisition and \\ndevelopment, including directly attributable fees and \\nexpenses, direct labour costs and borrowing costs. \\nIncluded within development properties are freehold \\ninterests held in completed developments valued at \\na multiple of annual ground rents. These are held for \\nfuture sale.\\nfinancial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are \\nrecognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the \\nGroup becomes a party to the contractual provision \\nof the instrument.\\nTrade receivables and other receivables\\nTrade receivables on normal terms do not carry \\nany interest and are stated at their nominal value \\nreduced by appropriate allowances for estimated \\nunrecoverable amounts.\\nCash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents are defined as cash \\nbalances in hand and in the bank (including short-\\nterm cash deposits) which mature within three \\nmonths or less from the date of acquisition.\\nBorrowings\\nInterest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are \\ninitially measured at fair value, being proceeds \\nreceived net of transaction costs and are \\nsubsequently measured at amortised costs, using \\nthe effective interest rate method.

Fair \\nvalue is determined by using the effective interest \\nmethod. The difference between the nominal value \\nand the initial fair value is amortised over the period \\nof the extended credit term and charged to finance \\ncosts, increasing the value of the land creditor so \\nthat at the date of maturity, the land creditor equals \\nthe payment required.\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are \\nclassified according to the substance of the \\ncontractual arrangements entered into. An equity \\ninstrument is any contract that evidences a residual \\ninterest in the assets of the Group after deducting \\nall of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the \\nGroup are recorded at the proceeds received, net of \\ndirect issue costs.\\nc urrent assets and liabilities\\nAssets that are expected to be realised in, or are \\nintended for sale or consumption in, the Group’s \\nnormal operating cycle are treated as current even \\nto the extent these are expected to be realised \\nafter twelve months from the balance sheet \\ndate. Liabilities that are expected to be settled in \\nthe Group’s normal operating cycle are treated \\nas current even though these may be due for \\nsettlement after twelve months from the balance \\nsheet date.\\nc ontingent liabilities\\nDisclosures are made for each class of contingent \\nliabilities at the balance sheet date detailing, where \\npracticable, an estimate of its financial effect and an \\nindication of uncertainties associated with the timing \\nor amount of the outflow, unless the possibility of a \\nfinancial outflow is remote.\\nt axation\\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the tax \\ncurrently payable and deferred tax.\\nThe tax currently payable is based on the profits \\nfor the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit \\nas reported in the income statement because it \\nexcludes items of income or expense that are tax \\ndeductible in other years and it further excludes \\nitems that are never taxable or deductible. The \\nGroup’s liability for current tax is calculated using \\ntax rates that have been enacted or substantively \\nenacted by the balance sheet date.\\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary \\ndifferences that have originated but not reversed at \\nthe balance sheet date where transactions or events \\nthat result in an obligation to pay more tax in the \\nfuture or a right to pay less tax in the future have \\noccurred at the balance sheet date.\\nA net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable \\nand therefore recognised only when, on the basis \\nof all available evidence, it can be regarded as \\nmore likely than not that there will be suitable \\ntaxable profits from which the future reversal of the \\nunderlying timing differences can be deducted.\\nDeferred tax is charged or credited in the income \\nstatement, except when it relates to items charged \\nor credited directly to equity, in which case the \\ndeferred tax is also dealt with in equity.\\nshare-based payments\\nIn accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of equity \\nsettled share options granted is recognised as an \\nemployee expense with a corresponding increase in \\nequity. The fair value is measured as at the date the \\noptions are granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton \\npricing model and is charged equally over the vesting \\nperiod. The amount recognised as an expense is \\nadjusted each reporting period to reflect the actual \\nnumber of options that are expected to vest.\\nWith respect to share-based payments, a deferred \\ntax asset is recognised on the relevant tax base. The \\ntax base is then compared to the cumulative share-\\nbased payment expense recognised in the income \\nstatement. Deferred tax arising on the excess of the \\ntax base over the cumulative share-based payment \\nexpense recognised in the income statement has \\nbeen recognised directly in equity.\\no wn shares\\nShares held by employee benefit trusts in order to \\nsatisfy awards under the Group’s share plans are \\nincluded net within equity until such time as the \\nshares are vested to the relevant employees.

Contract profit on construction \\ncontracts is recognised in proportion to revenue \\nonly to the extent that the total eventual profit on the \\ncontract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty.\\nAssessing the percentage complete on each contract \\ninvolves estimation of total expected costs to be \\nincurred until the end of the contract. Recognition \\nof profit also involves estimation of the total \\nexpected revenues from each contract and therefore \\nthe expected profit margin that will be achieved. \\nJudgement is required to assess whether the total \\neventual profit on each contract can be foreseen \\nwith reasonable certainty (note 11).\\nCarrying value of land and work in progress\\nInventories include land and work in progress in \\nrespect of development sites. On each development \\njudgement is required to assess whether the cost \\nof land and any associated work in progress is in \\nexcess of its net realisable value (note 10).\\nAdoption of new and revised standards  \\nand interpretations\\nDuring the year IFRIC 19 and amendments to \\nIAS 24 and IFRIC 14 have become effective and \\nhave been adopted by the Group.

Adoption of the new and revised \\nstandards and interpretations has not had any \\nsignificant impact on the amounts reported  \\nin these financial statements but may impact  \\nthe accounting for future transactions  \\nand arrangements.\\nAt the date of the authorisation of these financial \\nstatements, there are a number of standards, \\namendments and interpretations that have been \\npublished but are not yet effective for the year ended \\n31 March 2012 and have not been adopted early.\\nThe standards, amendments and interpretations \\nthat are expected to impact upon the Group are:\\n•\\t IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ \\nbuilds on existing principles by identifying the \\nconcept of control as the determining factor in \\nwhether an entity should be included within the \\nconsolidated financial statements. \\n•\\t IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ provides for a \\nmore realistic reflection of joint arrangements \\nby focusing on the rights and obligations of the \\narrangement, rather than its legal form. \\n•\\t IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interest in other entities’ \\nincludes the disclosure requirements for all forms \\nof interests in other entities. \\n•\\t IAS 28 (revised) ‘Investment in associates and \\njoint ventures’ includes the requirement for joint \\nventures to be equity accounted following the \\nissue of IFRS 11. \\nThe four standards above are all applicable to the \\nGroup from 1 April 2013 and are expected to have a \\npresentational impact on the Group as proportional \\nconsolidation will no longer be allowed.\\nThe following standards, amendments and \\ninterpretations are not expected to have any material \\nimpact on the financial statements of the Group:\\n•\\t IFRS 1 (amendment) ‘First time adoption’ on \\nhyperinflation and fixed dates is applicable to the \\nGroup from 1 April 2012.\\n•\\t IFRS 7 (amendment) ‘Financial instruments: \\nDisclosure’ is applicable to the Group from  \\n1 April 2012.\\n•\\t IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ is applicable to the \\nGroup from 1 April 2013.\\n•\\t IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ is applicable to \\nthe Group from 1 April 2013.\\n•\\t IAS 1 (amendment) ‘Presentation of financial \\nstatements’ is applicable to the Group from  \\n1 April 2013.\\n•\\t IAS 12 (amendment) ‘Income taxes’ is applicable \\nto the Group from 1 April 2012.\\n•\\t IAS 19 (amendment) ‘Employee benefits’ is \\napplicable to the Group from 1 April 2013.\\n•\\t IAS 27 (revised) ‘Separate financial statements’  \\nis applicable to the Group from 1 April 2013.

This \\ncharge is calculated at the date of grant of the options and is charged equally over the vesting period. The \\ncorresponding adjustment to equity is made directly to the profit and loss reserve. In accordance with IFRS 2 \\n(Share-based payments), only costs relating to options issued after 7 November 2002 have been charged to \\nthe income statement.\\nThe Group has used the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to calculate the fair value of outstanding options. \\nIndividual calculations have been performed for groups of share options with differing exercise prices and \\ndates. The assumptions applied to the Black-Scholes-Merton formula for share options issued in the year \\nended 31 March 2012 and the fair value per option are set out below.

Financial Statements\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk 67\\nTelford homes Plc Share Incentive Plan\\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2004 Telford h omes Plc set up a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) for the benefit \\nof all of the employees of the Group. This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and confers certain \\ntax advantages for participating employees.\\nThe SIP provides for employees to purchase shares up to a value of £1,500 in each tax year. These shares \\nare known as ‘Partnership shares’. Partnership shares are matched on a one for one basis by ‘Matching \\nshares’ provided by the Group subject to the shares remaining in the SIP for a period not less than three \\nyears. Dividends are paid on both Partnership and Matching shares and these are allocated to employees as \\n‘Dividend shares’.\\nThe Group has set up a trust to administer the SIP and to hold shares on behalf of individual employees. \\nThis trust is an entirely separate entity to the Group and is managed by a corporate trustee, Telford h omes \\nTrustees Limited. The costs associated with the trust are paid for by the Group and the Group finances all \\nshare purchases.\\nThe trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating in the \\nscheme. These shares remain in the trust until such time as an employee withdraws from the SIP. Further \\nshares have been allocated to employees as Matching shares and the cost of these shares is being written off \\nover the three year holding period. The charge in the year ended 31 March 2012 is £129,000 (2011: £138,000).\\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2012 the trust acquired 500,000 shares at 95.5p in March 2012. At \\n31 March 2012 the trust remains interested in 167,872 shares (2011: 52,176) which have not been allocated \\nto employees and a further 573,990 (2011: 967,861) that have been allocated to employees as Matching \\nshares but have not yet vested. Shares in which the trust remains interested do not rank for dividends and \\nall shares that have not yet vested do not count in the calculation of the weighted average numbers of shares \\nused to calculate earnings per share.\\nShares held by the SIP are recognised as a deduction from shareholders’ funds. The value of these shares at \\n31 March 2012 was £849,414 (2011: £680,758). Movements in the profit and loss reserve relating to the SIP \\nare shown in the statement of changes in equity.\\nTelford homes Plc 2006 Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan\\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2007 Telford h omes Plc set up a Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan \\n(DPSPP) for the benefit of selected senior employees. An employee benefit trust (the Telford h omes Plc \\n2006 Employee Benefit Trust) was set up with Abacus Corporate Trustee Limited acting as trustee.\\nParticipants in the DPSPP are offered a loan by the trustee to enable them to subscribe for a specified \\nnumber of shares in the Group at market value. This loan is interest free repayable on or before the \\nrepayment date which is normally 20 years from the date of the loan or on leaving employment or disposing \\nof the shares. The loan has a limited recourse such that repayment is limited to the value of the shares on \\nthe repayment date. The Group will lend the trustee sufficient funds to enable the trustee to provide the loans \\nto individual participants. All shares acquired under the DPSPP will be subject to a three year vesting period \\nand are held by the trustee for the benefit of the participants. Offers to participants will be made periodically \\nat the discretion of the directors of Telford homes Plc.\\nIn September 2006 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 550,000 shares at the \\nmarket value of 260p. These shares were issued on 9 November 2006. On this date the Group provided a \\nloan to the trustee of £1,430,000 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. This loan \\nis repayable at the earlier of the sale of the vested shares and November 2026 and has been recognised as a \\ndeduction from shareholders’ funds in the statement of changes in equity. In the year ended 31 March 2012, \\n£2,000 of this loan has been repaid leaving an outstanding balance of £1,428,000.\\nIn December 2007 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 160,000 shares at the \\nmarket value of 244p.

On 31 March 2011 the Group signed a £70 million loan facility which extends \\nto 30 September 2014 with a club of three banks being The Royal Bank of Scotland, hSBC and Santander. \\nThe debt drawn under this facility is secured against a portfolio of land and development sites owned by the \\nGroup. At 31 March 2012 the Group had utilised £46.2 million of this facility leaving an unutilised balance  \\nof £23.8 million. Interest is being charged on this facility at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.5%.\\nTelford h omes (Creekside) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary has a loan facility with The Royal Bank of \\nScotland in relation to its Greenwich Creekside development. The development is now complete in terms \\nof construction and at 31 March 2012, £14.6 million of the original £57.7 million facility was outstanding \\nfollowing significant repayments in the year from completion proceeds. The remaining £14.6 million is \\nrepayable in phases by 30 June 2012, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013. Included within the  \\n£14.6 million outstanding is a mezzanine loan facility of £8.0 million and interest on this loan is charged \\nat LIBOR plus a margin of 5%. Interest is charged on the remainder of the debt at LIBOR plus a margin \\nof 2.25%.\\nThe Group’s jointly controlled entity, Bishopsgate Apartments LLP has a £43.1 million development loan \\nfacility with hSBC which extends to the earlier of practical completion of the development in Bethnal Green \\nRoad or September 2014. The debt drawn under this facility is secured against the land and development \\nsite owned by the partnership. At 31 March 2012, Bishopsgate Apartments LLP had utilised £19.8 million of \\nthis facility leaving an unutilised balance of £23.3 million. Interest is being charged on this facility at LIBOR \\nplus a margin of 3.5%.\\nAll borrowings are treated as current even though these may be due for settlement after twelve months  \\nfrom the balance sheet date as they are expected to be settled in the Group’s normal operating cycle.  \\nAll borrowings are stated at fair value which is materially equivalent to the original book value.\\nMarket risk\\nThe Group is exposed to the financial risk of changes in interest rates both in terms of changes in the base \\nrate and LIBOR and in terms of individual banks attitude to market risk and their application of either base \\nrate or LIBOR to new facilities and the margin applied to each new facility.\\nIn order to assess the risk interest costs are forecast on a monthly basis over a five year period using \\nestimates of likely changes in rates and actual costs are compared to this forecast. Volatility of interest \\ncosts remained at an acceptable level in the year ended 31 March 2012 as LIBOR remains at a historically \\nlow level. Interest on all facilities currently held is charged at floating interest rates and the Group \\nassesses the requirement for fixing interest rates on a regular basis. The Group has purchased two interest \\nrate caps in the period. The interest rate caps are individually fair valued at each period end with any \\nmovement in the value being charged or credited to the income statement. The fair value of the caps at  \\n31 March 2012 was £31,000 and hedging costs of £293,000 have been charged to the income statement \\nin the year ended 31 March 2012.  \\nThe effect on the income statement of a 1% rise and a 1% fall in interest rates has been calculated to assess \\ninterest rate sensitivity. Based on average monthly borrowings in the year, a 1% rise in interest rates would \\nhave a negative effect of £684,000 before tax (2011: £504,000), a 1% fall in interest rates gives the same \\nbut opposite effect.\\nCapital risk\\nThe Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going \\nconcern in order to provide returns for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining \\nan appropriate capital structure to reduce the costs of capital. The Group considers its capital to be all of the \\ncomponents of equity and long term liabilities.\\nThe Group ensures that there are appropriate controls over the purchase of land and levels of work in \\nprogress in the business in order to appropriately manage its capital. In addition, the other methods by \\nwhich the Group can manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the level of \\nordinary dividends paid to shareholders, issuing new share capital and arranging debt. Financial Statements\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk 71\\nCredit risk\\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.\\nTrade and other receivables includes amounts recoverable on contracts which are due from housing \\nassociations and balances due from other Group undertakings. The Group considers the credit quality \\nof the various debtors to be good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is \\nconsidered to be low.\\nSurplus cash is held in secure bank deposit accounts with The Royal Bank of Scotland, hSBC and Santander.\\nLiquidity risk\\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations  \\nas they fall due.\\nThe Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows over a five \\nyear period and performing sensitivity analysis on these forecasts. The forecasts are necessarily subject \\nto a number of assumptions and judgements and these are tested on a reasonable basis by the sensitivity \\nanalysis. These forecasts and the related sensitivity analysis are reviewed by the directors in detail on a \\nmonthly basis. In addition all of the forecasts and supporting calculations are made available to each bank \\nfunding the Group on a monthly basis. The current forecasts show positive cash balances beyond the next \\ntwelve months even where this is subjected to sensitivity testing.\\nThe Group utilises bank facilities to ensure that adequate funding is available to cover working capital \\nrequirements and the directors consider that existing facilities are sufficient to cover funding requirements \\nin the foreseeable future both where these have already been utilised and where they are currently unutilised. \\nWhere facilities are due to expire within one year this is due to the timing of the relevant developments and \\ntherefore the expected repayment dates. In all of these cases the directors are satisfied that the loans are \\nexpected to be repaid by the date the facility expires.\\nThe Group’s bank facilities are subject to a number of general and financial covenants which are tested \\nperiodically by each bank.

This demonstrates that Tesco is coping well \\nwith the downturn. Despite the challenging conditions around \\nthe globe we have remained resilient and are growing as fast as \\nany major international retailer.\\nWe’ve made several new appointments to the t esco Board in the year, \\nincluding l aurie mcilwee who takes on the role of g roup Finance \\nDirector, replacing andrew Higginson who has been appointed c hief \\nexecutive of Retailing s ervices whilst retaining his responsibility for \\ng roup s trategy. \\nl aurie has been with t esco for nine years and has a very strong track-\\nrecord in both finance and operations. in his most recent role as \\nDistribution Director l aurie was responsible for transforming our \\nnetwork – a tremendous achievement. His appointment shows once \\nagain how careful management succession planning works in t esco \\nand i have every confidence he will do an outstanding job as our g roup \\nFinance Director. \\nWe’ve also appointed three strong new n on-executive Directors in \\nrecent months – Jacqueline t ammenoms Bakker, a former Director \\ng eneral at the ministry of t ransport in the n etherlands who has also \\nheld senior positions at mcKinsey & c o. and s hell, patrick c escau, \\nformer ceo of Unilever and Ken Hanna, c hairman of inchcape plc and \\nformer c Fo of c adbury. t hey bring with them a wealth of international, \\ncommercial and financial experience which will further strengthen our \\nBoard and support our plans for the long-term growth of the g roup.\\nWhilst the downturn has presented many challenges, it has also opened \\nup some opportunities. We have made two very significant acquisitions \\nthis year.\\nWe have acquired the remaining 50% of t esco personal Finance from \\nRoyal Bank of s cotland, a move which will enable us to develop an \\nalready very successful financial services offer towards our objective  \\nof becoming a full-service retail bank.\\nin s outh Korea we purchased 36 hypermarkets from e-land, mostly in \\ns eoul, which has put us in a very strong position to challenge for market \\nleadership in one of our most successful markets.\\nmost of our growth has again been organic – we’ve opened nine  \\nmillion square feet of new space this year, excluding the acquisition in \\ns outh Korea. in august we announced our entry into india, with plans \\nto establish a cash & carry operation and a franchise agreement with \\nt rent to support their s tar Bazaar hypermarkets. t his complements our \\nentries into c hina and the United s tates, giving us access to another of \\nthe world’s most important economies.\\nWhilst many of our customers are focused on managing their shopping \\nbudgets, it is still important to them that we behave responsibly in the \\ncommunities we serve. We now have a c ommunity plan for each \\ncountry and earlier in the year we launched our c ommunity promises. \\nt hese are: actively supporting local communities; buying and selling \\nour products responsibly; caring for the environment; giving customers \\nhealthy choices; and creating good jobs and careers.\\nWe’ve made some great progress this year – we’ve opened our \\ngreenest ever store at c heetham Hill in manchester, with a carbon \\nfootprint that is 70% smaller than a typical store – bringing our total \\nnumber of green stores across the g roup to 37. t his will be a blueprint \\nfor how we build stores in the future.\\no ur work to encourage customers to make greener decisions is going \\nwell. t hrough green c lubcard points we have reduced the number of \\nsingle-use carrier bags in the UK by 50% and we are finding innovative \\nways to use green c lubcard elsewhere – for example by rewarding \\ncustomers for cycling to our stores in s outh Korea.\\ni’m also pleased to announce that in the UK we have once again broken \\nour ‘c harity of the Year’ record, raising a remarkable £6.2 million for \\nmarie c urie c ancer c are.\\nalthough it was impossible to predict the scale of the global economic \\nslowdown, t esco has responded well by adjusting our business to this \\nenvironment. o ur 470,000 strong team have done a fantastic job – \\nstaying close to customers and reacting quickly to their changing needs \\naround the world.\\ni am confident that this hard work will continue as we press on with our \\nlong-term strategy which i believe will put us in an even stronger \\nposition once economies start to recover.\\nDavid Reid, Chairman 36%\\n33%\\n30%\\nUK \\nEUROPE\\nASIA \\nUS \\n1%\\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\\n37.0\\n43.1\\n46.6\\n51.8\\n59 .4\\nIndia\\nSouth Korea\\nChina\\nUK\\nPoland\\nSlovakia       \\nJapan\\nMalaysia\\nCzech Republic\\nHungary\\nUS\\nT urkey\\nThailand\\nRepublic \\nof Ireland\\n4 t esco at a glance\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\n£59.4bn\\nGroup sales\\nNo. 3\\n Third largest grocery retailer in the world\\n470,000\\nPeople\\n4,331\\nStores worldwide\\n14\\nCountries\\nGeographic locations\\nMarket Staff numbers Store numbers\\nChina 19,452 70\\nCzech Republic 12,677 113\\nHungary 21,356 149\\nJapan 4,007 135\\nMalaysia 9,872 29\\nPoland 23,569 319\\nRep.

We are also pleased with the early \\nperformance of Tesco Personal Finance under our ownership and \\nwith the converted Homever stores in South Korea. As a result,  \\nwe have delivered a solid sales and profit performance, both in  \\nthe UK and internationally, whilst continuing to invest in our long-\\nterm strategy for growth. We have made a good start to the new \\nfinancial year and I am confident Tesco will continue to make good \\nprogress even in the current global economic environment. \\nQ: It has been a very tough time for the economy but the good \\nnews is it has been very sturdy growth for Tesco. How have you \\nmanaged that?\\nA: it has been a very good year and mainly of course that is the dividend of \\nhaving a long-term, consistent strategy. We’ve invested into this slowdown \\nand that has given us good momentum through the recession. We are \\ngrowing fast in our overseas countries, laying out networks of stores \\nand we are still opening new space in the UK as well. in addition to that, \\nof course, people have to eat – we’re blessed in that sense, so we don’t \\nface the worst of the slowdown. We’ve also adjusted our business both in \\nthe UK and around the world to make sure that we offer better value \\nand better ranges which keeps customers in the stores, and helps \\nvolume in the business. \\nQ: You’re very much in the front line when it comes to knowing \\nwhat customers are thinking, how they are behaving. Are there \\nany signs that we have perhaps reached the bottom of the \\nrecession? What lies in store for the economy do you think?\\nA: it is very fluid at the moment – changes are happening over weeks,  \\nso i don’t think you can see any clear direction yet. What i would say is \\nthat it looks as if things are stabilising on the consumer front. in the UK \\nthe lower interest rates help, as do the lower fuel prices and energy  \\nprices, and coupled with the work that we have done in reducing food \\nprices for customers – this helps rebuild confidence. in c entral europe  \\nthe economies had a big decline early in the summer and the autumn  \\nof 2008 – that feels as if it has levelled out, which is encouraging. in asia  \\nit is too early to say. t heir decline came later with the destocking of the \\nsupply chain and so for them it really hit around December. t hese are \\nstrong economies and the destocking will end and we’ll start to get  \\nrestocking in the pipeline which will help. \\nQ: Priorities change during a recession – for business and \\ncustomers alike. Is there a risk that the focus on green and \\ncorporate responsibility slips somewhat?\\nA: it is important that it doesn’t and it’s one of the reasons we lay  \\nsuch emphasis within t esco on our ‘s teering Wheel’ – our balanced \\nscorecard – so that whatever is going on in the outside world, we  \\nkeep focused on the things that matter long term. o f course price  \\nand trading is important at the moment, but there are big long-term \\nobjectives around community and the environment that we have got  \\nto stay committed to. t esco has to help customers change from mass \\nconsumption to green consumption. o n climate change, we’ve got to \\nlearn how to run this business on 80% less carbon. We have got great \\nplans and we are making great progress. o f course it helps the business \\ntoo – not wasting things is a very good habit at a time like this and one \\nof the reasons our energy bills are down £100 million this year is because \\nof all of the green initiatives we’ve been working on over several years. \\nQ: Bearing in mind what you have seen in the US so far, are you \\npleased with the progress? \\nA: i am, yes, because there’s lots to be pleased about. c learly nobody  \\nwould have chosen to open into the scale of recession that we’ve seen \\nthere, which is particularly stiff in the Western United states, but the \\ncustomers love the stores and they appeal right across the income range \\nand the age range, and that bodes very well for their long-term appeal. \\nFresh & easy is more than just a niche retailer – it’s a new and different \\nform of retailing. c ustomers obviously like the fresh foods and they  \\nlike the own-brand products, but also are increasingly recognising the \\ntremendous prices that are on offer and of course that is very important \\nat the moment. t he operation is very good and it’s strong. We really \\nhave created the business that we set out to create in terms of the \\nhighest, freshest quality in the market at the best prices in the local \\nneighbourhood. We are expanding the business at a good rate and \\nmorale is high. \\nQ: What excites you most about the year ahead?\\nA: First of all we’re growing – and we’re serving more customers. t hey \\nhave needs; they are just different needs at a time like this. it’s what \\nt esco is for – to stay close to customers and change as their needs \\nchange. t hat’s got to take a different form in different categories or in \\ndifferent parts of the world. it’s important you have strong, confident \\nlocal leadership teams who take the responsibility to make those \\nchanges. i believe that is happening. if you look at our businesses – \\nwhether it’s non-food, financial services or in our international markets \\n– we are growing strongly and we are growing market share. t here’s \\nmore that we have to do from place to place, but confidence is high. \\npeople know what they have to do and have the authority to do it. \\nAt a time when customers everywhere are \\nfeeling the economic strain, we are responding  \\nto their changing needs in all our markets by \\nlowering prices, introducing more affordable \\nproducts and offering even sharper promotions.\\nSir Terry Leahy, Chief Executive\\nTo see a full video interview go to\\nwww.tesco.com/annualreport09/presentations COMMUNITY    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCUSTOMER\\nTHE STAFF \\nARE GREAT\\nI DON’T QUEUE\\nTHE PRICES\\nARE GOOD\\nI CAN GET \\nWHAT I WANT\\nTHE AISLES \\nARE CLEAR\\nEARN LIFETIME\\nLOYAL TY\\nOPERATIONS\\nWE ALWAYS SAVE\\nTIME AND MONEY\\nWE KNOW\\nHOW VITAL OUR\\nJOBS ARE\\nWE MAKE OUR\\nJOBS EASIER\\nTO DO\\nWE DELIVER\\nCONSISTENTLY\\n EVERY DAY\\nWE TRY TO\\nGET IT RIGHT\\n FIRST TIME\\nCREATING\\nGOOD JOBS AND\\nCAREERS\\nGIVING CUSTOMERS\\nHEALTHY CHOICES\\nCARING FOR THE\\nENVIRONMENT\\nBUYING AND SELLING OUR\\n PRODUCTS RESPONSIBLY\\nACTIVEL Y\\nSUPPORTING LOCAL\\nCOMMUNITIES\\nPEOPLE\\nAN OPPORTUNITY\\nTO GET ON\\nAN INTERESTING \\nJOB\\nA MANAGER WHO \\nHELPS ME\\nTO BE TREATED \\nWITH RESPECT\\nFINANCE\\nMANAGE OUR\\nINVESTMENT\\nMAXIMISE \\nPROFIT\\nGROW SALES\\nTREAT PEOPLE HOW WE LIKE TO BE TREATED\\nNO-ONE TRIES HARDER FOR CUSTOMERS\\n6 Repo Rt o F t He DiRecto Rs\\nt he Directors present their annual Report to shareholders on the  \\naffairs of the g roup and c ompany, together with the audited financial \\nstatements of the c ompany for the 53 weeks ended 28 February 2009.\\nLong-term strategy\\nt esco has a well-established and consistent strategy for growth, which \\nhas allowed us to strengthen our core UK business and drive expansion \\ninto new markets. t he rationale for the strategy is to broaden the scope \\nof the business to enable it to deliver strong, sustainable long-term \\ngrowth by following the customer into large expanding markets at \\nhome – such as financial services, non-food and telecoms – and new \\nmarkets abroad, initially in c entral europe and asia, and more recently \\nin the United s tates.\\nt he strategy to diversify the business was laid down in 1997 and has been \\nthe foundation of t esco’s success in recent years. t he new businesses \\nwhich have been created and developed over the last 12 years as part \\nof this strategy now have scale, they are competitive and profitable – in \\nfact we are now market leader in many of our markets outside the UK.\\nt he g roup has continued to make good progress with this strategy, which \\nhas five elements, reflecting our four established areas of focus, and  \\nalso t esco’s long-term commitments on community and environment. \\nimportantly, the momentum which it has given the business has allowed \\nthe g roup to continue to grow well through the economic downturn.\\nt he objectives of the strategy are:\\n• \\t t o \\t b e \\t a \\t s u c c e ss f u l \\t in t e r n a t i o n a l \\t r e t a i le r ;\\n• \\t t o \\t g r o w \\t t he \\t c o r e \\t U K \\t b u s ine ss;\\n• \\t t o \\t b e \\t a s \\t st r o ng \\t in \\t no n - f o o d \\t a s \\t in \\t f o o d ;\\n• \\t \\t t o \\t d e v e lo p \\t r e t a i ling \\t s e r v i c e s \\t – \\t s u c h \\t a s \\t T e s c o \\t P e r s o n a l \\t F in anc e ,\\t\\nt elecoms and tesco.com; and\\n•\\t to \\t p ut \\t c ommunit y \\t at \\t t he \\t hear t \\t of \\t w hat \\t we \\t do .\\nin 2008/9, t esco has again delivered a good performance, with all  \\nparts of the strategy contributing. We have sustained solid growth in \\nthe UK and coped well with the challenges of recession and improving \\ncompetitors. in our international operations we have made good \\nprogress, completing a large programme of new store openings and \\ncarefully adjusting our businesses locally to the effects of the global \\neconomic slowdown. We have also acquired 36 hypermarkets in  \\ns outh Korea, our largest market outside the UK, in a move which has \\nsignificantly strengthened our market position there, and begun the \\ngroundwork for a wholesale cash & carry business in india. \\nin non-food, we continue to grow sales and market share and maintain \\nprofitability, against a background of a declining general retail market, \\nand we have seen excellent growth from t esco Direct, which extends \\nour reach in selling a broad range of products on the internet and via  \\nThis Business Review analyses \\nthe performance of the Tesco \\nGroup in the financial year  \\nended 28 February 2009. It also \\nexplains other aspects of the \\nGroup’s markets, results and \\noperations, including strategy \\nand risk management.\\nBusiness review\\nWe operate a balanced scorecard approach to managing the \\nbusiness that is known within the Group as our Steering Wheel. \\nThis unites the Group’s resources and in particular focuses the \\nefforts of our staff around our customers, people, operations, \\nfinance and the community. Its purpose is to ensure Tesco puts \\nappropriate balance into the trade-offs that need to be made  \\nall the time between the main levers of management – such as \\ndelivery of customer metrics, operations measures and financial \\nmeasures. It enables the business to be operated and monitored \\non a balanced basis with due regard to the needs of all stakeholders. \\nFor the owners of the business, it is simply based around the \\nphilosophy that if we look after customers well and operate \\nefficiently and effectively, shareholders’ interests will always be \\nbest served by the inevitable outputs of those – growth in sales, \\nprofits and returns.\\nOur long-term strategy\\nInternational\\nTesco is an international retailer and wherever we operate we \\nfocus on giving local customers what they want.

Finally, our work on community and environment \\ncontinues – we have recently opened our latest blueprint green store at \\nc heetham Hill, manchester, which has a carbon footprint 70% lower \\nthan a normal store.\\nMarkets served and business model\\nt esco’s growth, driven by this strategy, has been predominantly  \\norganic and we have used our skills and knowledge in understanding \\ncustomers, property development, supply chain management, new \\nproduct development, store formatting and adapting to local customer \\nneeds – to create strong business models in our chosen markets. Where \\nwe do not have all the required skills ourselves to be successful, we \\nregularly partner with existing businesses – and these relationships \\nhave formed the basis of some of our most successful operations –  \\nfor example with s amsung in s outh Korea.\\nt he UK grocery retail market remains our largest source of revenue, \\nrepresenting some 50% of last year’s £59.4 billion of sales. international \\nretail sales – from our 12 markets in europe, asia and the United s tates, \\ncomprise a further 30% of g roup revenues and non-food (in a variety \\nof categories from health and beauty to electronics) accounts for most \\nof the remainder. o ur services businesses have comparatively small \\nrevenue streams, but they are increasingly material to our earnings base. \\nWe have given them a renewed focus this year – deploying more capital \\nand management resources. a first key step in making these already \\nsuccessful businesses much larger and more significant to the g roup  \\nwas the acquisition of Royal Bank of s cotland’s share of t esco personal \\nFinance – and we expect these businesses, including our online shopping \\nchannels, t elecoms and dunnhumby (our consumer research business) \\nto deliver £1 billion a year of profit for the g roup within the next few years.\\nat the core of t esco’s business model is a focus on trying to improve what \\nwe do for customers. We aim to make their shopping experience as easy \\nas possible, lower prices where we can to help them spend less, give \\nthem more choice about how they shop – in small stores, large stores or \\nonline – and seek to bring simplicity and value to sometimes complicated \\nmarkets. We aim to be a good neighbour in the communities we serve, \\nbe responsible, fair and honest in our dealings and give customers the \\ninformation and products they need to make greener choices. We are \\nalso an inclusive business – everyone is welcome at t esco.\\nUnderpinning this approach is a relentless attitude to being the lowest \\ncost provider of goods and services in our chosen sectors – and this \\ncombination of qualities is the reason we have been successful in some \\nof the world’s most competitive markets. We have recognised skills and \\nproprietary systems in key areas which help us deliver a low cost model \\n– particularly in customer relationship management, just-in-time supply \\nchain and distribution, property development and store formatting.  \\nin some of our newer markets – such as telecoms or financial services, our \\nwillingness to partner with established businesses has given us access \\nto their existing investment in systems and infrastructure and enabled \\nt esco to develop competitive, profitable business models quickly and, \\nat the same time, limit our own investment and risk in the early years.  \\nin the case of financial services, having successfully partnered with  \\nRoyal Bank of s cotland for a decade we now have the experience to take \\nsole ownership in order to pursue our aim of becoming a full-service retail \\nbank and give t esco personal Finance the focus that this will require.\\nMy main challenge is to maintain the balance between staying on \\nstrategy while living within our means. For a growth company like \\nTesco it is vital of course that we meet the challenges posed by the \\neconomic downturn – and the priorities there are the same as for \\nany finance director in the current environment – in helping the \\nbusiness to find the resources to invest for customers, by keeping  \\na good grip on costs and cash.\\nAt the same time though, I need to do what I can to help sustain Tesco’s \\ninvestment in future growth. By investing in the right opportunities, \\nprotecting ourselves from unpredictable capital markets and trading \\nin a sustainable way we should exit this recession as an even stronger \\ncompany. That’s how Tesco emerged as a winner from the last \\nrecession. Exciting opportunities are there to be grasped – for example, \\nland and property are already significantly cheaper, our online \\nbusinesses are not capital intensive and, given the loss of confidence in \\nthe banking sector, our very conservative, straightforward approach in \\nTesco Personal Finance may be exactly what customers are looking for.\\nLaurie Mcllwee Group Finance Director\\nSales by region Sales growth contribution by region\\nAs Group Finance Director, what are your \\npriorities at the moment? 8 Repo Rt o F t He DiRecto Rs\\nWe’ve long understood that retailing is \\nlocal. Each team on the ground is able to \\nadjust our offer to each market because \\ncustomers in China, for example, aren’t the \\nsame as those in Poland or South Korea. \\nSo we’ve never tried to run the international \\nbusiness from our office in the UK. In fact, \\nwe have very few expats working outside \\nthe UK – in South Korea just six out of a \\nteam of over 20,000 people. As we face \\ninto some strong economic headwinds,  \\nit’s more important than ever to stay  \\nclose to customers and be able to adapt \\nquickly locally as their needs change. \\nWe have people in each of our markets \\nwho have a wealth of experience and  \\nare able to make the decisions that  \\nreally matter. \\nA big part of my job is about making sure \\nwe’ve got the right people in each country, \\nsharing experience around the business \\nand empowering people to do the right \\nthings for their customers. \\nPhilip Clarke International and IT Director\\nHow do you run successful \\nbusinesses in so many countries?\\nInternational \\nsales up\\n31% 9 Repo Rt o F t He DiRecto Rs\\nTesco PLC annual Report and Financial s tatements 2009\\nacross our markets customers are changing their shopping habits as \\nthey are affected to varying degrees by the global economic downturn. \\nin this kind of environment, it is more important than ever to listen to \\ncustomers and adapt quickly to their changing needs.\\neach of our markets is different so it’s up to the individual businesses to \\nadjust their offer locally. Using customer insight allows our experienced \\nteams on the ground to make decisions based on real customer data. \\nWe have spent many years developing our customer insight skills, \\nparticularly through dunnhumby, the consumer research company \\nbehind our loyalty scheme, c lubcard. t hrough careful analysis of sales \\nand loyalty card data we can better understand what is important to \\nour customers. t his year we have been using this unique insight across \\nmost parts of our business so we don’t have to guess what our \\ncustomers want, we know.\\nin all our markets it’s helping us select the most important items for \\nprice-sensitive or cost-conscious shoppers so we can invest in lowering \\nprices on the most important items to help customers through tough \\neconomic times. For example, in malaysia, we have reviewed our  \\nrange of staple foods and groceries and as a result we have introduced \\n27 new products to the basket, which we know are among the most \\nimportant for customers. We now make sure that we are not beaten  \\non price for these products.\\nt his insight is also helping us to make things simpler for customers to \\nshop in our stores. For example, in asia we have worked with our leading \\nsupplier of baby milk. By reviewing the sales data we discovered that \\ndisplaying the products by brand rather than by age was important so \\nwe are changing the layout on the shelves to make it easier for customers \\nto find the products they want. \\nWhilst it is important to invest in the shopping trip we are also \\ncontinuing to invest for future growth. t his is a strategy that has served \\nus well in the past; for example we entered t hailand and s outh Korea \\nduring the asian economic crisis in the 1990s and emerged stronger \\nonce the economies started to recover. We are now market leader in \\nt hailand and following our acquisition of 36 hypermarkets in s outh \\nKorea we are now in a very strong position to challenge for market \\nleadership there as well.\\nWe also announced our entry into the indian market last year. We are \\nestablishing a cash & carry business that will offer a comprehensive range \\nof great value fresh food, grocery and non-food products to small \\nretailers, restaurants, kirana stores and other business owners. We will \\nalso provide farmers and other suppliers with a highly efficient route to \\nmarket. in addition, we have signed an exclusive franchise agreement \\nwith t rent, the retail arm of the t ata g roup. t rent currently operates four \\ns tar Bazaar hypermarkets, with plans to grow to 50 stores over the next \\nfive years. We will supply these hypermarkets with products, but also \\noffer our retail expertise and technical capability to support the \\ndevelopment of their business.\\nt he overall performance of our international businesses during the year \\nhas been strong, particularly against the background of increasingly \\nchallenging trading conditions in all of our markets as the effects of  \\nthe economic downturn on consumers have grown and spread around \\nthe world. \\nWe have delivered very good sales and profit growth and our investment \\nreturns have held up well. importantly, we have grown share in all of our \\nmarkets and in some countries we have made more rapid progress this \\nyear by sticking to our strategy as competitors falter. By continuing to focus \\non doing the right things for customers – lowering prices, introducing more \\naffordable products, offering even stronger promotions – they have \\nrewarded us with good sales and market share growth. By keeping our \\ncosts low and pushing on with expansion, we aim to take the opportunity \\nto strengthen further our market positions during the recession. \\nInternational\\nIt’s been another good year for our international business which \\nnow spans 13 countries across Asia, Europe and the United States. \\nAs customers around the world are feeling the effects of the global \\neconomic slowdown we are successfully adjusting our offer in all \\nour markets to help customers who are feeling the pinch.\\nLoyalty card schemes\\nWe have national loyalty card schemes based on Clubcard in \\nIreland, Malaysia, South Korea and China and pilot schemes  \\nin Slovakia, Poland, Thailand and Turkey. 10 Repo Rt o F t He DiRecto Rs\\nTesco PLC annual Report and Financial s tatements 2009\\nin most of our markets we are now amongst the largest, most profitable \\nand fastest growing businesses – and this is a good platform from \\nwhich to make further progress, even in tough times. o ur experience  \\nin Hungary of trading profitably and growing well during an already \\nprolonged recession which began in 2006, also gives us confidence  \\nthat by applying what we have learned there in our other markets, the \\nbusiness can perform well through the current environment. \\neurope – including ireland, t urkey and the four c entral european \\ncountries – and the Western Us have seen the most marked effects  \\nof the economic downturn although more recently, as the export-led \\neconomies of asia – particularly s outh Korea and c hina – have also \\nslowed, trading conditions there too have deteriorated.\\nin europe, these challenges have been joined by the consequences of \\nsubstantial exchange rate movements between the euro or euro-linked \\ncurrencies and other currencies within the european Union. t hese \\nmovements have encouraged very significant increases in cross-border \\nshopping by consumers in several regions – the clearest examples \\nbeing ireland into n orthern ireland, c zech Republic into g ermany and \\ns lovakia into poland. o ur stores located close to these borders have \\nseen material sales impacts as customers take advantage of devalued \\ncurrencies and this has affected the rate of sales growth overall in  \\nthese markets.\\nalthough in some markets we have moderated our rate of growth in space, \\noverall we have chosen to sustain strong growth in selling area – and this \\nwill continue.

We plan to fund the growth of the g roup predominantly from internal sources – recognising \\nthe current uncertainties in financial markets – and this will be achieved by reducing capital expenditure to below our operating cash flow.\\ng roup capital expenditure (excluding acquisitions) rose to £4.7bn (last year £3.9bn), slightly higher than the forecast made at our interim Results. \\nt his increase compared with last year was attributable principally to the purchase of a small number of trading stores from a competitor and investment \\nin new mixed-use development schemes in the UK, combined with higher international capital expenditure, including our initial investment in freehold \\nshopping centre developments in c hina. Furthermore, international capital spending, and as a result total g roup expenditure, was impacted by the \\ndecline in s terling relative to most of our trading currencies.\\nUK capital expenditure was £2.6bn (last year £2.3bn). t otal international capital expenditure rose to £2.1bn (last year £1.6bn) comprising £0.9bn  \\nin a sia, £0.9bn in europe and £0.3bn in the Us . 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\\n1.9\\n2.3\\n2.5\\n2.8\\n3.1\\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\\n2,334\\n2,672\\n3,263\\n3,751\\n4 , 33 2\\nTesco PLC annual Report and Financial s tatements 2009\\n35 Repo Rt o F t He DiRecto Rs\\nUnderlying profit before tax (£bn) Number of stores\\nTo find out more go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreport09\\nWe are now reducing UK capital spend on large mixed-use development schemes and we have purchased fewer existing trading stores from \\ncompetitors, allowing UK capital expenditure to revert to the levels of four years ago. importantly this is being achieved whilst continuing to meet \\nour objective of adding some 6 to 7% to our UK selling space annually. in some of our markets, such as the Us , we are taking a more cautious \\napproach to expansion during the downturn and we are also seeing substantial falls in store site and build costs. t aken together, these changes \\nmean that we are able to plan for g roup capital expenditure to reduce substantially this year to around £3.5bn, whilst still delivering strong organic \\ngrowth in g roup selling space of around 9% in the current year. \\nc ash flow from operating activities totalled £5.0bn (last year £4.1bn), including an improvement of £582m within working capital, driven in  \\npart by good control of stock. n et debt rose to £9.6bn at the year-end (last year £6.2bn). £1.9bn of this increase is attributable to the impact  \\nof acquiring tp F and Homever, and a further £1.0bn to the effect of unfavourable currency movements. \\nWe are targeting a reduction in net debt in the current year, driven by lower capital expenditure, property divestments, lower stock levels and other \\nimprovements in working capital.\\nProperty in april 2006, we announced plans to release cash from property through a sequence of joint ventures and other sale and leaseback \\ntransactions, in the UK and internationally and return significant value to shareholders, both through enhanced dividends (through the growth in \\nunderlying earnings per share, which includes property profits) and share buy-backs. We have managed the pace of this programme in light of the \\ncurrent financial and property market conditions, and as a result we have divested the property at attractive yields. \\nt he transactions completed so far – with pension funds, property companies and other investors – have delivered aggregate proceeds of £2.2bn. \\nWhilst yields have increased modestly in recent months, we expect to be able to complete further transactions on attractive terms in the months ahead \\nand we are currently in discussion with potential counterparties. proceeds for the remainder of this year will principally be used to pay down debt.\\nt he net book value of our fixed tangible assets is £24.7bn, most of it in our freehold store portfolio – even after recent property divestments linked \\nto our £5bn programme. We estimate the current market value of these assets to be £30.4bn, representing a 23% premium to book value.\\nPensions o ur award-winning defined-benefit pension scheme is an important part of our competitive benefits package, which helps t esco  \\nrecruit and retain the best people. t he trustees manage and fund our scheme on an actuarial valuation basis and, at our triennial valuation dated \\n31 march 2008, the scheme had a small deficit of £275m. \\nFollowing the valuation, member and company contributions have increased and, to further improve the security of the scheme for members,  \\nthe trustees will be granted contingent property assets worth £500m.\\na s at February 2009, under the ias 19 methodology of pension liability valuation, the scheme had a deficit on a post-tax basis of £1.1bn (last year \\n£0.6bn). t his change has been driven mainly by falls in capital markets and other asset classes, although the deficit is similar to the level reported \\nat our interim results.\\nReturn on capital employed in January 2004, we said that we had an aspiration to increase our post-tax return on capital employed (Roce )  \\nof 10.2% in the 2002/3 financial year by 200 basis points over five years on then current plans. in april 2006, we renewed our commitment to \\nincreasing our post-tax return on capital employed (Roce ) by a further 200 basis points, having exceeded our 2004 aspiration early. \\nRoce rose slightly to 13.0% in the year before the effect of the two major acquisitions – tp F and Homever – which were completed in the  \\nsecond half. t his represents a good performance and we remain on track to deliver our targeted Roce improvement in the years ahead as these \\ninvestments mature.

We need to \\nunderstand and properly manage strategic risk in order to deliver long-\\nterm growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders. our strategy is based \\non five elements: to become a successful international retailer, to grow the \\ncore UK business, be as strong in non-food as in food, develop retailing \\nservices and put the community at the heart of what we do. pursuit of this \\nfive-part strategy has allowed the business to diversify and, at a strategic \\nlevel, diversification and pursuit of growth in emerging markets have the \\neffect of reducing overall risk by avoiding reliance on a small number of \\nbusiness areas. However, by its very nature, diversification also introduces \\nnew risks to be managed in areas of the business that are less mature and  \\nless fully understood. \\nt o ensure the g roup continues to pursue the right strategy, the Board \\ndiscusses strategic issues at every Board meeting, and dedicates two full \\ndays a year to reviewing the g roup’s strategy. t he executive c ommittee  \\nalso holds specific sessions to discuss strategy on a regular basis.

We monitor performance \\nand governance of our joint ventures and partnerships.\\nFinancial review\\nt he main financial risks faced by the g roup relate to the availability of \\nfunds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties to \\nfinancial transactions, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates \\nand credit rating risks. t hese risks are managed as described below. t he \\ng roup Balance sheet position at 28 February 2009 is representative of  \\nthe position throughout the year.\\nFunding and liquidity t he g roup finances its operations by a \\ncombination of retained profits, long and medium-term debt, capital \\nmarket issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. t he \\nobjective is to ensure continuity of funding. t he policy is to smooth the \\ndebt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and  \\nto maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities, and a strong \\ncredit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due.\\nt esco g roup has a long-term rating of a 3 by moody’s and a- by s tandard \\nand poor’s with a stable outlook. n ew funding of £5.6bn was arranged \\nduring the year, including a net £0.7bn from property transactions and \\n£4.9bn from medium-term notes (mtn s). at the year end, net debt was \\n£9.6bn (last year £6.2bn).\\nInterest rate risk management t he objective is to limit our exposure to \\nincreases in interest rates while retaining the opportunity to benefit from \\ninterest rate reductions. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps \\nand collars are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.\\nt he policy is to fix or cap a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt \\ninterest costs of the g roup excluding tp F. at the year end, £6.3bn of debt \\nwas in fixed rate form (last year £2.5bn) with a further £0.7bn of debt capped \\nor collared, therefore 72% (2008 – 55%) of net debt is fixed, capped or \\ncollared. t he remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. t he \\naverage rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis excluding joint \\nventures and associates this year was 5.2% (last year 4.5%).\\nForeign currency risk management our principal objective is to reduce \\nthe effect of exchange rate volatility on short-term profits. t ransactional \\ncurrency exposures that could significantly impact the g roup income \\ns tatement are hedged, typically using forward purchases or sales of \\nforeign currencies and currency options. at the year end, forward foreign \\ncurrency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to \\n£2,110m were outstanding (2008 – £1,198m) as detailed in note 22. We \\nhedge the majority of our investments in our international subsidiaries via \\nforeign exchange transactions in matching currencies. our objective is to \\nmaintain a low cost of borrowing and hedge against material movements \\nin our g roup Balance s heet value. During the year, currency movements \\nincreased the net value of the g roup’s overseas assets by £480m (last year \\nincrease of £284m). We translate overseas profits at average foreign \\nexchange rates which we do not currently seek to hedge.\\nCredit risk t he objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from  \\ndefault by parties to financial transactions across an approved list of \\ncounterparties of high credit quality. t he g roup’s positions with these \\ncounterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored.\\nTesco Personal Finance (TPF) tp F became a wholly owned subsidiary \\nof t esco g roup on 19 December 2008. in preparation for this change the \\nrisk management and treasury capabilities of tp F have been materially \\nstrengthened. all policies pertaining to risk within tp F are now subject  \\nto tp F governance procedures which are owned by the tp F Board.\\ntp F has a banking business, predominantly in the UK, with the three main \\nproducts being credit cards, unsecured personal loans and savings. tp F \\nhas also developed a significant insurance business, with motor, home  \\nand pet insurance being the main products. \\nc redit risk, arising from its unsecured lending, is managed using all the \\nnormal reporting and collections and recoveries systems. in terms of \\nliquidity risk tp F has implemented a conservative approach to the \\nminimum amount of liquid assets its holds and to its core funding ratio of \\ncustomer assets/customer liabilities. tp F has at this stage in its development \\nan increased element of operational risk as it currently outsources most of \\nits operations to Royal Bank of s cotland g roup whilst at the same time it is \\nin the process of building new banking and insurance systems. tp F retains \\nprofit and loss risk to its insurance activities of which a large weather \\nrelated event would generate the largest adverse variance.\\nInsurance We purchased assets, earnings and c ombined l iability \\nprotection from the open insurance market at ‘catastrophe’ level only.  \\nt he risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the \\nbusiness by using our captive insurance companies, t esco insurance \\nl imited in g uernsey and valiant insurance c ompany l imited in the \\nRepublic of ireland. t esco insurance l imited covers assets and earnings, \\nwhile valiant insurance c ompany l imited covers c ombined l iability. \\nStatement of compliance\\nt his Business Review has been prepared in accordance with the \\nrequirements for a business review under the c ompanies acts 1985  \\nand 2006. \\nt he Business Review’s intent is to provide information to shareholders  \\nand should not be relied on by any other party or for any other purpose. \\nCautionary statement regarding  \\nforward-looking information\\nWhere this review contains forward-looking statements, these are made  \\nby the Directors in good faith based on the information available to them  \\nat the time of their approval of this report. t hese statements should be \\ntreated with caution due to the inherent risks and uncertainties underlying \\nany such forward-looking information.\\nt he g roup cautions investors that a number of important factors, \\nincluding those in this document, could cause actual results to differ \\nmaterially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. s uch \\nfactors include, but are not limited to, those discussed under ‘Risks and \\nuncertainties’ on pages 38 to 40 of this document.

We have a structured \\ninternal communications programme that provides employees with  \\na clear definition of the Group’s purpose and goals, accountabilities  \\nand the scope of permitted activities for each business unit, as well as \\nindividual line managers and other employees. t his ensures that all our \\npeople understand what is expected of them and that decision-making \\ntakes place at the appropriate level. We recognise that our people may  \\nface ethical dilemmas in the normal course of business so we provide clear \\nguidance based on the t esco Values. t he Values set out the standards  \\nthat we wish to uphold in how we treat people. t hese are supported by  \\nthe Group c ode of ethics which offers guidance on relationships between \\nthe Group and its employees, suppliers and contractors. t he c ompany  \\nis a signatory to the dti c ode of c onduct and met its obligations for \\nimplementing the c ode for the financial year ended 28 f ebruary 2009. \\nWe operate a balanced scorecard approach that is known within the  \\nGroup as our s teering Wheel. t his unites the Group’s resources around  \\nour customers, people, operations, community and finance. t he scorecard \\noperates at every level within the Group, from ground level business units, \\nthrough to country level operations. it enables the business to be operated \\nand monitored on a balanced basis with due regard for all stakeholders.  48 report of the directors\\nTesco PLC Annual r eport and f inancial s tatements 2009\\nRisk management  \\nt he Group maintains a Key r isk r egister. t he r egister contains the key \\nrisks faced by the Group including their impact and likelihood as well as \\nthe controls and procedures implemented to mitigate these risks. t he \\ncontent of the r egister is determined through regular discussions with \\nsenior management and review by the executive c ommittee and the full \\nBoard. A balanced approach allows the degree of controllability to be taken \\ninto account when we consider the effectiveness of mitigation recognising \\nthat some necessary activities carry inherent risk which may be outside  \\nthe Group’s control. our risk management process recognises there are \\nopportunities to improve the business to be built into our future plans.  \\nour key risks are summarised on pages 38 to 40 of the Business r eview. \\nt he risk management process is cascaded through the Group with every \\ninternational ceo and local Boards maintaining their own risk registers \\nand assessing their control systems. t he same process also applies \\nfunctionally in those parts of the Group requiring greater overview. f or \\nexample, the Audit c ommittee’s t erms of r eference require it to oversee \\nthe f inance r isk r egister. We also have a c orporate r esponsibility r isk \\nr egister which specifically considers s ocial, ethical and environmental \\n(see ) risks. o versight of these risks is the responsibility of the c orporate \\nr esponsibility c ommittee. t he Board assesses the significant see risks to \\nthe Group’s short-term and long-term value, and incorporates see risks on \\nthe Key r isk r egister where they are considered material or appropriate.\\nWe recognise the value of the ABi Guidelines on r esponsible investment \\nd isclosure and confirm that, as part of its regular risk assessment \\nprocedures, the Board takes account of the significance of see matters  \\nto the business of the Group. We recognise that a number of investors  \\nand other stakeholders take a keen interest in how companies manage \\nsee matters and so we report more detail on our see policies and \\napproach to managing material risks arising from see matters and the \\nKpis we use both on our website (www.tesco.com/cr-report09) and in  \\nour Annual c orporate r esponsibility r eview 2009. \\nInternal controls  \\nt he Board is responsible for the c ompany’s system of internal control and \\nfor reviewing the effectiveness of such a system. We have a Group-wide \\nprocess for clearly establishing the risks and responsibilities assigned to \\neach level of management and the controls which are required to be \\noperated and monitored. \\nt he ceo s of subsidiary businesses are required to certify by way of annual \\nstatements of assurance that the Board’s governance policies have been \\nadopted both in practice and in spirit. f or certain joint ventures, the Board \\nplaces reliance upon the internal control systems operating within our \\npartners’ infrastructure and the obligations upon partners’ Boards relating \\nto the effectiveness of their own systems.  \\ns uch a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of \\nfailure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable  \\nand not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. \\nt he Board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of internal controls \\nand is satisfied that the controls in place remain appropriate.\\nMonitoring  \\nt he Board oversees the monitoring system and has set specific \\nresponsibilities for itself and the various committees as set out below.  \\nBoth internal Audit and our external auditors play key roles in the \\nmonitoring process, as do several non-statutory committees including the \\nf inance c ommittee, c ompliance c ommittee and c orporate r esponsibility \\nc ommittee. t he Minutes of the Audit c ommittee and the various non-\\nstatutory committees (f inance, c ompliance and c orporate r esponsibility \\nc ommittees) are distributed to the Board and each committee submits a \\nreport for formal discussion at least once a year. t hese processes provide \\nassurance that the Group is operating legally, ethically and in accordance \\nwith approved financial and operational policies. \\nAudit Committee  \\nt he Audit c ommittee reports to the Board each year on its review of  \\nthe effectiveness of the internal control systems for the financial year  \\nand the period to the date of approval of the financial statements. \\nt hroughout the year the c ommittee receives regular reports from the \\nexternal auditors covering topics such as quality of earnings and technical \\naccounting developments. t he c ommittee also receives updates from \\ninternal Audit and has dialogue with senior managers on their control \\nresponsibilities. it should be understood that such systems are designed  \\nto provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material \\nmisstatement or loss. \\nInternal Audit  \\nt he internal Audit department is fully independent of business operations \\nand has a Group-wide mandate. it undertakes a programme to address \\ninternal control and risk management processes with particular reference \\nto the t urnbull Guidance. it operates a risk based methodology, ensuring \\nthat the Group’s key risks receive appropriate regular examination. its \\nresponsibilities include maintaining the Key r isk r egister, reviewing and \\nreporting on the effectiveness of risk management systems and internal \\ncontrol with the executive c ommittee, the Audit c ommittee and ultimately \\nto the Board. internal Audit facilitates oversight of risk and control systems \\nacross the Group through audit and compliance committees in each of our \\ninternational businesses and our joint ventures. t he h ead of internal Audit \\nalso attends all Audit c ommittee meetings. \\nExternal audit  \\npricewaterhousec oopers LLp, the c ompany’s external auditor, contributes \\na further independent perspective on certain aspects of our internal \\nfinancial control systems arising from its work, and reports to both the \\nBoard and the Audit c ommittee. t he engagement and independence of \\nexternal auditors is considered annually by the Audit c ommittee before it \\nrecommends its selection to the Board. t he c ommittee has satisfied itself \\nthat pricewaterhousec oopers LLp is independent and there are adequate \\ncontrols in place to safeguard its objectivity. o ne such measure is the non-\\naudit services policy that sets out criteria for employing external auditors and \\nidentifies areas where it is inappropriate for pricewaterhousec oopers LLp to \\nwork. Non-audit services work carried out by pricewaterhousec oopers LLp  \\nis predominantly the review of subsidiary undertakings’ statutory accounts, \\ntransaction work and corporate tax services, where pWc ’s services are \\nconsidered to be the most appropriate. pricewaterhousec oopers LLp also \\nfollows its own ethical guidelines and continually reviews its audit team to \\nensure its independence is not compromised. \\nFinance Committee  \\nt he f inance c ommittee, which is not a statutory committee, is chaired  \\nby the ceo , s ir t erry Leahy, and membership includes Non-executive \\nd irectors with relevant financial expertise, executive d irectors and \\nmembers of senior management. t he c ommittee usually meets twice  \\na year and its role is to review and agree the f inance plan on an annual \\nbasis to review reports of the t reasury and t ax functions, and to review \\nand approve t reasury limits and delegations. \\nCompliance Committee  \\nt he c ompliance c ommittee, which is not a statutory committee, is chaired \\nby the c orporate and Legal Affairs d irector, Lucy Neville-r olfe, and \\nincludes three executive d irectors and members of senior management. \\nt he c ommittee normally meets six times a year and its remit is to ensure \\nthat the Group complies with all necessary laws and regulations in all of  \\nits operations world-wide. t he committee has established a schedule  \\nfor the regular review of operational activities and legal exposure. each \\ninternational business in the Group has a local compliance committee \\ndesigned to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations as well  \\nas Group compliance policies, and each country compliance committee \\nreports to the Group c ompliance c ommittee on a regular basis. \\nCorporate governance continued 49 report of the directors\\nTesco PLC Annual r eport and f inancial s tatements 2009\\nTo find out more go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreport09\\nCorporate Responsibility Committee  \\nt he c orporate r esponsibility c ommittee, which is not a statutory \\ncommittee, is chaired by the c orporate and Legal Affairs d irector, Lucy \\nNeville-r olfe and membership is made up of senior executives from across \\nthe Group. it meets at least four times a year to support, develop and \\nmonitor policies on social, ethical and environmental issues, reviewing \\nthreats and opportunities for the Group. progress in developing \\nc ommunity initiatives is monitored by the use of relevant Kpis in the  \\nUK and our international businesses. t he Board formally discusses the \\nwork of the c ommittee on a regular basis, including progress in \\nimplementing our c ommunity plan. \\nt he c orporate and Legal Affairs department and the t rading Law and \\nt echnical department provide assurance and advice on legal compliance, \\nhealth and safety, and see matters. t hese functions report on their work \\non a regular basis and escalate matters as appropriate. \\nWhistleblowing  \\nt he Group operates a whistleblowing policy and has a confidential \\n‘protector Line’ service accessible to concerned employees where they  \\ncan report, anonymously if necessary, on issues of malpractice within  \\nthe business. t hese issues include unethical behaviour such as fraud, \\ndishonesty and any practices that endanger our staff, customers or  \\nthe environment. \\nc omplaints made are treated as confidential and are investigated.  \\nWhere appropriate, matters will be escalated to the d irector of Group \\ns ecurity for further action.\\nManagement  \\nin our fast moving business, trading is tracked on a daily and weekly basis, \\nfinancial performance is reviewed weekly and monthly, and the s teering \\nWheel is reviewed quarterly. s teering Wheels are operated in business \\nunits across the Group, and reports are prepared of performance against \\ntarget Kpis on a quarterly basis enabling management to measure \\nperformance. All major initiatives require business cases normally covering \\na minimum period of five years. post-investment appraisals, carried out by \\nmanagement, determine the reasons for any significant variance from \\nexpected performance. \\nRelations with stakeholders\\nWe are committed to having a constructive dialogue with stakeholders  \\nto ensure we understand what is important to them and allow ourselves \\nthe opportunity to present our position. engagement helps us identify  \\nnew risks and opportunities to ensure that our long-term strategy is \\nsustainable. in some instances we find that working with stakeholders in \\npartnership can help deliver shared goals.

t ax (eBit ) and r eturn o n c apital employed (roce ) targets set by reference to the us long-term business plan.\\n3  a percentage of the eBit of the us business for the relevant years may be allocated to an eBit pool (the ‘profit pool’). t he profit pool will be capped at 10% in any one year and is expected \\nto be approximately 5% of cumulative eBit over the four measurement years (2010/11 to 2013/14). t he portion of an award which may vest will be determined by reference to the value of \\nthe eBit pool as well as performance against the roce hurdles for the relevant year, as outlined in the table above. t o the extent that the roce hurdles for any one year are met (either in \\nfull or in part), but there is insufficient value in the profit pool to fund the vesting of awards, then the actual vesting in that year will be scaled back so that the profit pool is not exceeded. \\nt hat portion of the award that has not paid out in that year due to the profit pool being restricted may vest in future years, provided that the profit pool in any later year permits this.\\n4  t he targets for the us L tip have been based on the business plan in respect of the initial phase of the us business. t he r emuneration c ommittee has the responsibility to review these \\ntargets in light of the scale and scope of the us business in order to ensure that they remain appropriate and challenging. in particular, the r emuneration c ommittee will seek the input of \\nthe audit c ommittee and the Governance o versight c ommittee in order to ensure that financial performance against the targets is indicative of strong and robust business performance. \\nany material adjustments made in respect of the targets will be reviewed and approved by the audit c

The address of the registered office is Tesco House, Delamare \\nRoad, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, EN8 9SL, UK.\\nThe financial year represents the 53 weeks to 28 February 2009 (prior \\nfinancial year 52 weeks to 23 February 2008) and includes 53 weeks of \\ntrading for the UK, Republic of Ireland (ROI) and United States of America \\n(US) businesses.\\nAs described in the Report of the Directors, the main activity of the Group \\nis that of retailing and financial services.\\nStatement of compliance\\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance \\nwith International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International \\nFinancial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) interpretations as \\nendorsed by the European Union, and those parts of the Companies Acts \\n1985 and 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.\\nBasis of preparation\\nThe financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, rounded to the \\nnearest million. They are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for \\ncertain financial instruments, share-based payments and pensions that \\nhave been measured at fair value.\\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to  \\nall periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.\\nBasis of consolidation\\nThe Group financial statements consist of the financial statements of  \\nthe ultimate Parent Company (Tesco PLC), all entities controlled by the \\nCompany (its subsidiaries) and the Group’s share of its interests in joint \\nventures and associates.\\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of \\nsubsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to bring the accounting policies \\nused into line with those of the Group.\\nSubsidiaries\\nA subsidiary is an entity whose operating and financing policies are \\ncontrolled, directly or indirectly, by Tesco PLC.\\nThe accounts of the Parent Company’s subsidiary undertakings are \\nprepared to dates around the Group year end.\\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated \\nfinancial statements from the date that control commences until the date \\nthat control ceases.\\nIntragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and \\nexpenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing \\nthe consolidated financial statements.\\nJoint ventures and associates\\nA joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long-\\nterm basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more \\nother venturers under a contractual agreement.\\nAn associate is an undertaking, not being a subsidiary or joint venture,  \\nover which the Group has significant influence and can participate in the \\nfinancial and operating policy decisions of the entity.\\nThe Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates is included \\nin the Group Income Statement using the equity method of accounting. \\nInvestments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group Balance \\nSheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net \\nassets of the entity, less any impairment in value. The carrying values of \\ninvestments in joint ventures and associates include acquired goodwill.\\nIf the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or \\nexceeds its investment in the joint venture or associate, the Group does \\nnot recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so  \\nor made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.\\nUnrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures and \\nassociates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.\\nUse of assumptions and estimates\\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires \\nmanagement to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect \\nthe application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, \\nincome and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are \\nbased on historical experience and various other factors that are believed \\nto be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the \\nbasis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities \\nthat are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ \\nfrom these estimates.\\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing \\nbasis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in \\nwhich the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or  \\nin the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both \\ncurrent and future periods.\\nCritical estimates and assumptions are made in particular with regard to \\nestablishing uniform depreciation and amortisation periods for the Group, \\nimpairment testing (including loans), provisions for onerous leases and \\ndilapidations, assumptions for measuring pension provisions and fair  \\nvalue of share-based payments, determination of the fair value of \\nobligations to purchase minority interests and fair value of derivative \\nfinancial instruments, classification of leases as operating leases versus \\nfinance leases (including on sale and leasebacks), the likelihood that tax \\nassets can be realised and the classification of certain operations as held \\nfor sale.\\nRevenue\\nRetailing\\nRevenue consists of sales through retail outlets.\\nRevenue is recorded net of returns, relevant vouchers/offers and value-\\nadded taxes, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have \\nbeen transferred to the buyer. Relevant vouchers/offers include: money-off \\ncoupons, conditional spend vouchers and offers such as buy one get one \\nfree (BOGOF) and 3 for 2.\\nCommission income is recorded based on the terms of the contracts and  \\nis recognised when the service is provided.\\nFinancial Services\\nRevenue consists of interest, fees and commission receivable.\\nInterest income on financial assets that are classified as loans and \\nreceivables is determined using the effective interest rate method. This  \\nis the method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or for  \\na group of assets, and of allocating the interest income over the expected \\nlife of the asset. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the \\nestimated future cash flows to the instrument’s initial carrying amount. \\nCalculation of the effective interest rate takes into account fees receivable, \\nthat are an integral part of the instrument’s yield, premiums or discounts \\non acquisition or issue, early redemption fees and transaction costs. \\nNote 1 Accounting policies 73 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nTo find out more go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreport09\\nFees in respect of services are recognised on an accruals basis as service  \\nis provided. The arrangements are generally contractual and the cost of \\nproviding the service is incurred as the service is rendered. The price is \\nusually fixed and always determinable. Significant fee types include credit \\ncard related services fees such as interchange, late payment and balance \\ntransfer fees. \\nInsurance commission received by the Group is accrued over the term  \\nof the policy.\\nClubcard and loyalty initiatives\\nThe cost of Clubcard is treated as a cost of sale, with an accrual equal to \\nthe estimated fair value of the points issued recognised when the original \\ntransaction occurs. On redemption, the cost of redemption is offset \\nagainst the accrual.\\nThe fair value of the points awarded is determined with reference to the \\ncost of redemption and considers factors such as redemption via Clubcard \\ndeals versus money-off in-store and redemption rate.\\nComputers for Schools and Sport for Schools and Clubs vouchers are \\nissued by Tesco for redemption by participating schools/clubs and are part \\nof our overall Community Plan. The cost of the redemption (i.e. meeting \\nthe obligation attached to the vouchers) is treated as a cost rather than as \\na deduction from sales.\\nOther income\\nFinance income, excluding income arising from financial services is \\nrecognised in the period to which it relates on an accruals basis. Dividends \\nare recognised when a legal entitlement to payment arises.\\nOperating profit\\nOperating profit is stated after profit arising on property-related items but \\nbefore the share of results of joint ventures and associates, finance income \\nand finance costs.\\nProperty, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and any recognised impairment in value. \\nProperty, plant and equipment assets are depreciated on a straight-line \\nbasis to their residual value over their anticipated useful economic lives.\\nThe following depreciation rates are applied for the Group:\\n Freehold and leasehold buildings with greater than 40 years unexpired – •\\t\\nat 2.5% of cost;\\n Leasehold properties with less than 40 years unexpired are depreciated •\\t\\nby equal annual instalments over the unexpired period of the lease; and\\n Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings and motor vehicles – at rates •\\t\\nvarying from 9% to 50%.\\nAssets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful \\nlives on the same basis as owned assets or, when shorter, over the term of \\nthe relevant lease.\\nAll tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with \\nIAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ when there are indications that the carrying \\nvalue may not be recoverable.\\nBorrowing costs\\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction  \\nof qualifying assets are capitalised. Qualifying assets are those that \\nnecessarily take a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended \\nuse. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Group Income \\nStatement in finance costs, excluding those arising from financial services, \\nin the period in which they occur.\\nFor Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited interest expense on financial \\nliabilities is determined using the effective interest rate method and is \\nrecognised in cost of sales. \\n \\nInvestment property\\nInvestment property is property held to earn rental income and/or for \\ncapital appreciation rather than for the purpose of Group operating \\nactivities. Investment property assets are carried at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and any recognised impairment in value. The depreciation \\npolicies for investment property are consistent with those described for \\nowner-occupied property.\\nLeasing\\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease \\ntransfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. \\nAll other leases are classified as operating leases.\\nThe Group as a lessor\\nAmounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as \\nreceivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the leases. \\nFinance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a \\nconstant periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment in the lease.\\nRental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis \\nover the term of the relevant lease.\\nThe Group as a lessee\\nAssets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group  \\nat their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease \\npayments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding \\nliability is included in the Group Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. \\nLease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction \\nof the lease obligations so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the \\nremaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the \\nGroup Income Statement.\\nRentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Group Income \\nStatement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.\\nSale and leaseback\\nA sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an asset and \\nimmediately reacquires the use of that asset by entering into a lease with \\nthe buyer. The accounting treatment of the sale and leaseback depends \\nupon the substance of the transaction (by applying the lease classification \\nprinciples described above) and whether or not the sale was made at the \\nasset’s fair value.\\nFor sale and finance leasebacks, any apparent profit or loss from the sale  \\nis deferred and amortised over the lease term. For sale and operating \\nleasebacks, generally the assets are sold at fair value, and accordingly the \\nprofit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately.\\nFollowing initial recognition, the lease treatment is consistent with those \\nprinciples described above.\\nBusiness combinations and goodwill\\nAll business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.\\nOn acquisition, the assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and \\ncontingent liabilities of an acquired entity are measured at their fair value. \\nThe interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion \\nof the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.\\nThe Group recognises intangible assets as part of business combinations  \\nat fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of these fair \\nvalues is based upon management’s judgement and includes assumptions \\non the timing and amount of future incremental cash flows generated by \\nthe assets acquired and the selection of an appropriate cost of capital. The \\nuseful lives of intangible assets are estimated, and amortisation charged \\non a straight-line basis.\\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued 74 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nGoodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of an \\nacquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets/net \\nliabilities of the acquired subsidiary, joint venture or associate at the date  \\nof acquisition. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the \\nGroup’s share of the net assets/net liabilities of the acquired entity  \\n(i.e. a discount on acquisition) then the difference is credited to the  \\nGroup Income Statement in the period of acquisition. \\nAt the acquisition date of a subsidiary, goodwill acquired is recognised as \\nan asset and is allocated to each of the cash-generating units expected to \\nbenefit from the business combination’s synergies and to the lowest level \\nat which management monitors the goodwill. Goodwill arising on the \\nacquisition of joint ventures and associates is included within the carrying \\nvalue of the investment.\\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually by assessing the \\nrecoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill \\nrelates. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, \\nand value in use. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating \\nunit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.\\nAny impairment is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement \\nand is not subsequently reversed.\\nOn disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable \\namount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss  \\non disposal.\\nGoodwill arising on acquisitions before 29 February 2004 (the date of \\ntransition to IFRS) was retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject \\nto being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves \\nunder UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been restated and will not be \\nincluded in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.\\nIntangible assets\\nAcquired intangible assets\\nAcquired intangible assets, such as software, pharmacy licences, customer \\nrelationships, contracts and brands, are measured initially at cost and are \\namortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, at \\n2%-100% of cost per annum.\\nInternally-generated intangible assets – Research and  \\ndevelopment expenditure\\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. \\nDevelopment expenditure incurred on an individual project is carried \\nforward only if all the criteria set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ are  \\nmet, namely:\\n an asset is created that can be identified (such as software or new •\\t\\nprocesses);\\n it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic •\\t\\nbenefits; and\\n the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. •\\t\\nFollowing the initial recognition of development expenditure, the cost is \\namortised over the project’s estimated useful life, usually at 14%-25%  \\nof cost per annum.\\nImpairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill\\nAt each Balance Sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its \\ntangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication \\nthat those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication \\nexists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to \\ndetermine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does \\nnot generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group \\nestimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the \\nasset belongs. \\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and \\nvalue in use. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating \\nunit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount \\nof the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. \\nAn impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.\\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount  \\nof the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate \\nof the recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount \\ndoes not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if \\nno impairment loss had been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating \\nunit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as \\nincome immediately.\\nOther investments\\nOther investments in the Group Balance Sheet comprise equity \\ninvestments and available-for-sale financial assets. Refer to the financial \\ninstruments accounting policy for further detail.\\nEquity investments are recognised at amortised cost and available-for-sale \\nfinancial assets are recognised at fair value.\\nInventories\\nInventories comprise goods held for resale and properties held for, or in \\nthe course of, development and are valued at the lower of cost and fair \\nvalue less costs to sell using the weighted average cost basis.\\nShort-term investments\\nShort-term investments in the Group Balance Sheet consist of deposits \\nwith money market funds. \\nCash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents in the Group Balance Sheet consist of cash at \\nbank, in hand and demand deposits with banks together with short-term \\ndeposits with an original maturity of three months or less.\\nNon-current assets held for sale\\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale  \\nif their carrying amount will be recovered through sale rather than \\ncontinuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is \\nhighly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate \\nsale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale \\nand it should be expected to be completed within one year from the date \\nof classification.\\nNon-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are \\nmeasured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\\nPensions and similar obligations\\nThe Group accounts for pensions and other post-employment benefits \\n(principally private healthcare) under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.\\nIn respect of defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted \\npresent value (using the projected unit credit method) whilst plan assets \\nare recorded at fair value. The operating and financing costs of such plans \\nare recognised separately in the Group Income Statement; service costs \\nare spread systematically over the expected service lives of employees and \\nfinancing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise. Actuarial \\ngains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group Statement of \\nRecognised Income and Expense.\\nPayments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense \\nas they fall due.\\nNotes to the Group financial statements continued\\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued 75 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nTo find out more go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreport09\\nShare-based payments\\nEmployees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of \\nshare-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services  \\nin exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions)  \\nor in exchange for entitlements to cash payments based on the value of \\nthe shares (cash-settled transactions).\\nThe fair value of employee share option plans is calculated at the grant \\ndate using the Black-Scholes model. In accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-\\nbased payment’, the resulting cost is charged to the Group Income \\nStatement over the vesting period. The value of the charge is adjusted  \\nto reflect expected and actual levels of vesting.\\nTaxation\\nThe tax expense included in the Group Income Statement consists of \\ncurrent and deferred tax. \\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, \\nusing tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet \\ndate. Tax is recognised in the Group Income Statement except to the \\nextent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case  \\nit is recognised in equity. \\nDeferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method, \\nproviding for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of \\nassets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts  \\nused for taxation purposes. \\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or \\nsubstantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred tax is charged \\nor credited in the Group Income Statement, except when it relates to items \\ncharged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also \\nrecognised in equity.\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that \\ntaxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary \\ndifferences can be utilised.\\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance \\nSheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that \\nsufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset  \\nto be recovered.\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when  \\nthere is a legally enforceable right to set-off current taxation assets  \\nagainst current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these  \\non a net basis.\\nForeign currencies\\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on \\nthe date of the transaction. At each Balance Sheet date, monetary assets \\nand liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated \\nat the rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. All differences are taken \\nto the Group Income Statement for the period.\\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Pounds \\nSterling according to the functional currency concept of IAS 21 ‘The \\nEffects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’. Since the majority of \\nconsolidated companies operate as independent entities within their local \\neconomic environment, their respective local currency is the functional \\ncurrency. Therefore, assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries \\ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated at exchange rates \\nprevailing at the date of the Group Balance Sheet; profits and losses are \\ntranslated into Pounds Sterling at average exchange rates for the relevant \\naccounting periods. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as \\nequity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation \\ndifferences are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which \\nthe operation is disposed of.\\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign \\nentity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and \\ntranslated at the closing rate.\\nFinancial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s \\nBalance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual \\nprovisions of the instrument.\\nTrade receivables\\nTrade receivables are non interest-bearing and are recognised initially at \\nfair value, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nrate method, reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated \\nirrecoverable amounts.\\nInvestments\\nInvestments are recognised at trade date. Investments are classified as \\neither held for trading or available-for-sale, and are recognised at fair value.\\nThere are no investments classified as held for trading.\\nFor available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes  \\nin fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed \\nof or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or \\nloss previously recognised in equity is included in the net result for the \\nperiod. Interest calculated using the effective interest rate method is \\nrecognised in the Group Income Statement. Dividends on an available-for-\\nsale equity instrument are recognised in the Group Income Statement \\nwhen the entity’s right to receive payment is established.\\nLoans and advances\\nLoans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or \\ndeterminable payments that are not quoted in an active market and \\ninclude amounts due from customers and amounts due from other  \\nbanks. The Group has no intention of trading these loans and advances \\nand consequently they are not classified as held for trading or designated  \\nas fair value through profit and loss. Loans and advances are initially \\nrecognised at fair value plus directly related transaction costs. Subsequent \\nto initial recognition, these assets are carried at amortised cost using the \\neffective interest method less any impairment losses. Income from these \\nfinancial assets is calculated on an effective yield basis and is recognised  \\nin the Group Income Statement.\\nImpairment of loans and advances\\nAt each Balance Sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of  \\nits loans and advances to determine whether there is any indication that \\nthose assets have suffered an impairment loss. An impairment loss has \\nbeen incurred if there is objective evidence that an event or events since \\ninitial recognition of the asset have adversely affected the amount or \\ntiming of future cash flows from the asset.\\nIf there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a financial asset  \\nor group of financial assets classified as loans and advances has been \\nincurred, the Group measures the amount of the loss as the difference \\nbetween the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets and the \\npresent value of estimated future cash flows from the asset or group of \\nassets discounted at the effective interest rate of the instrument at initial \\nrecognition. Impairment losses are assessed individually for financial assets \\nthat are individually significant and collectively for assets that are not \\nindividually significant. In making collective assessments of impairment, \\nfinancial assets are grouped into portfolios on the basis of similar risk \\ncharacteristics. Future cash flows from these portfolios are estimated on \\nthe basis of the contractual cash flows and historical loss experience for \\nassets with similar credit risk characteristics. Historical loss experience is \\nadjusted, on the basis of current observable data, to reflect the effects  \\nof current conditions not affecting the period of historical experience.\\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued 76 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nImpairment losses are recognised in the Group Income Statement and the \\ncarrying amount of the financial asset or group of financial assets reduced \\nby establishing an allowance for impairment losses. If in a subsequent \\nperiod the amount of the impairment loss reduces and the reduction  \\ncan be ascribed to an event after the impairment was recognised, the \\npreviously recognised loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance. Once  \\nan impairment loss has been recognised on a financial asset or group of \\nfinancial assets, interest income is recognised on the carrying amount \\nusing the rate of interest at which estimated future cash flows were \\ndiscounted in measuring impairment.\\nLoan impairment provisions are established on a portfolio basis taking  \\ninto account the level of arrears, security, past loss experience, credit  \\nscores and defaults based on portfolio trends. The most significant factors \\nin establishing the provisions are the expected loss rates and the related \\naverage life. The portfolios include credit card receivables and other \\npersonal advances. The future credit quality of these portfolios is subject \\nto uncertainties that could cause actual credit losses to differ materially \\nfrom reported loan impairment provisions. These uncertainties include  \\nthe economic environment, notably interest rates and their effect on \\ncustomer spending, the unemployment level, payment behaviour and \\nbankruptcy trends.\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to  \\nthe substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity \\ninstrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of  \\nthe Group after deducting all of its liabilities.\\nInterest-bearing borrowings\\nInterest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair \\nvalue, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial \\nrecognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost  \\nwith any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised \\nin the Group Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an \\neffective interest basis.\\nTrade payables\\nTrade payables are non interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.\\nEquity instruments\\nEquity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds \\nreceived, net of direct issue costs.\\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to \\nforeign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operating, financing \\nand investing activities. The Group does not hold or issue derivative \\nfinancial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives do not \\nqualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for as such.\\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. \\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by \\nreference to market values for similar financial instruments, by discounted \\ncash flows, or by the use of option valuation models. Where derivatives do \\nnot qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement \\nare immediately recognised in the Group Income Statement. Where \\nderivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant  \\ngain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the  \\nitem being hedged.\\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document \\nfrom inception the relationship between the item being hedged and the \\nhedging instrument. The Group is also required to document and \\ndemonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item \\nand the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly \\neffective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is performed at \\neach period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.\\nDerivative financial instruments with maturity dates of more than one year \\nfrom the Balance Sheet date are disclosed as non-current.\\nFair value hedging\\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges  \\nwhen they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of  \\na recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that  \\nare designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group \\nIncome Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the \\nhedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.\\nDerivative financial instruments qualifying for fair value hedge accounting \\nare principally interest rate swaps (including cross currency swaps).\\nCash flow hedging\\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when \\nthey hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that are either \\nattributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or \\nliability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction.\\nThe effective element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative \\ninstrument is recognised directly in equity.\\nThe associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and \\nrecognised in the Group Income Statement in the same period or periods \\nduring which the hedged transaction affects the Group Income Statement. \\nThe classification of the effective portion when recognised in the Group \\nIncome Statement is the same as the classification of the hedged \\ntransaction. Any element of the remeasurement of the derivative \\ninstrument which does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is \\nrecognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance \\nincome or costs.\\nDerivative instruments qualifying for cash flow hedging are principally \\nforward foreign exchange transactions and currency options.\\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires  \\nor is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge \\naccounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the \\nhedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the \\nforecasted transaction occurs or the original hedged item affects the \\nGroup Income Statement. If a forecasted hedged transaction is no longer \\nexpected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity  \\nis transferred to the Group Income Statement.\\nNet investment hedging\\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges \\nwhen they hedge the Group’s net investment in an overseas operation. \\nThe effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from \\nremeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in equity.  \\nAny ineffective element is recognised immediately in the Group Income \\nStatement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the \\nGroup Income Statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.\\nDerivative instruments qualifying for net investment hedging are \\nprincipally forward foreign exchange transactions and currency options.\\nNotes to the Group financial statements continued\\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued 77 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nTo find out more go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreport09\\nTreatment of agreements to acquire minority interests\\nThe Group has entered into a number of agreements to purchase the \\nremaining shares of subsidiaries with minority shareholdings.\\nUnder IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’, the net present value \\nof the expected future payments are shown as a financial liability. At the \\nend of each period, the valuation of the liability is reassessed with any \\nchanges recognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income \\nor costs for the year. Where the liability is in a currency other than Pounds \\nSterling, the liability has been designated as a net investment hedge. Any \\nchange in the value of the liability resulting from changes in exchange \\nrates is recognised directly in equity.\\nSecuritisation transactions\\nDuring 2008/9 the Group has entered into a securitisation transaction  \\nand issued debt securities. The debt securities in issue and the loans and \\nadvances to customers are recorded on the Group’s Balance Sheet within \\ncurrent borrowings and loans and advances to customers.\\nProvisions \\nProvisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive \\nobligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that a transfer \\nof economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and where  \\na reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\\nProvisions for onerous leases are recognised when the Group believes  \\nthat the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations exceed the \\neconomic benefits expected to be received under the lease. Where \\nmaterial these leases are discounted to their present value. Provisions  \\nfor dilapidation costs are recognised on a lease by lease basis.\\nRecent accounting developments\\nStandards, amendments and interpretations effective for 2008/9  \\nor issued and early adopted:\\nIn preparing the Group financial statements for the current year, the Group \\nhas adopted the following new IFRS, amendments to IFRS and IFRIC \\nInterpretations which have not had a significant impact on the results or \\nnet assets of the Group:\\n Amendments to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and •\\t\\nMeasurement’ and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, effective \\nfrom 1 July 2008. These amendments permit the reclassification of \\nfinancial assets in particular circumstances. The adoption of the \\namendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 has had no impact on the results  \\nor net assets of the Group.\\n IFRIC 11 ‘Group and Treasury Share Transactions’, effective for annual •\\t\\nperiods beginning on or after 1 March 2007.\\n IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’, effective for annual periods •\\t\\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2008. This interpretation applies to \\npublic sector service concession operators and explains how to account \\nfor the obligations undertaken and rights received in service concession \\narrangements. No member of the Group is an operator and hence the \\nadoption of IFRIC 12 has had no impact on the results or net assets of \\nthe Group.\\nStandards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective,  \\nbut not expected to have a significant impact on the Group:\\n IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, effective for annual periods beginning on •\\t\\nor after 1 January 2009. This new standard replaces IAS 14 ‘Segment \\nReporting’ and requires segmental information to be presented on the \\nsame basis that management uses to evaluate performance of its \\nreporting segments in its management reporting. We do not expect the \\nadoption of IFRS 8 to have a significant impact upon the results or net \\nassets of the Group.\\n Amendment to IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’, effective for annual periods •\\t\\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2009. The standard has been revised  \\nto require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to  \\na qualifying asset. We do not expect the adoption of the amendment  \\nto IAS 23 to have a significant impact upon the results or net assets of \\nthe Group.\\n IFRIC 14 ‘The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding •\\t\\nRequirements and their Interaction’, effective for annual periods \\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2009 as endorsed by the EU. This \\ninterpretation provides guidance on how to assess the limit on the \\namount of surplus in a defined benefit scheme that can be recognised \\nas an asset under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. We do not expect the \\nadoption of IFRIC 14 to have a significant impact upon the results  \\nor net assets of the Group.\\nStandards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective  \\nand under review as to their impact on the Group:\\n Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, effective •\\t\\nfor annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. \\nAmendment to IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial •\\t\\nStatements’, effective for annual periods beginning on or after  \\n1 July 2009.\\nAmendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and IAS 1 •\\t\\n‘Presentation of Financial Statements’– Puttable Instruments and \\nInstruments with Obligations Arising on Liquidation, effective for  \\nannual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. \\nAmendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and •\\t\\nMeasurement’– Eligible hedged items, effective for annual periods \\nbeginning on or after 1 July 2009. \\nAmendments to IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of IFRSs’ and IAS 27 •\\t\\n‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’– Cost of an \\nInvestment of a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate, \\neffective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after  \\n1 January 2009.\\nAmendment to IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payment’– Vesting Conditions  •\\t\\nand Cancellations, effective for annual periods beginning on or after  \\n1 January 2009.\\nAmendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, effective for business •\\t\\ncombinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning \\nof the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009.\\nIFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’, effective for annual periods •\\t\\nbeginning on or after 1 July 2008. This interpretation requires customer \\nloyalty award credits to be accounted for as a separate component of \\nthe sales transaction in which they are granted and therefore part of the \\nfair value of the consideration received is allocated to the award credits \\nand deferred over the period that the award credits are fulfilled. \\nIFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’, effective for •\\t\\nannual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.\\nIFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’, effective •\\t\\nfor annual periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008.\\nIFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners’, effective for •\\t\\nannual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.\\nIFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’, effective for transfers  •\\t\\nof assets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009.\\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued 78 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nNotes to the Group financial statements continued\\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued\\nIFRS 3 Amortisation charge from intangible assets arising on acquisition •\\t\\n– Under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, intangible assets are separately \\nidentified and valued. The intangible assets are required to be amortised \\non a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives and as such is a \\nnon-cash charge that does not reflect the underlying performance of \\nthe business acquired.\\n Exceptional items – Due to their significance and special nature, certain •\\t\\nother items which do not reflect the Group’s underlying performance \\nhave been excluded from underlying profit. These gains or losses can \\nhave a significant impact on both absolute profit and profit trends; \\nconsequently, they are excluded from the underlying profit of the \\nGroup. There are no exceptional items in 2008/9 and 2007/8. \\nSegmental trading profit\\nSegmental trading profit is an adjusted measure of operating profit, which \\nmeasures the performance of each geographical segment before profit/\\n(loss) arising on property-related items, impact on leases of annual uplifts \\nin rent and rent-free periods, amortisation charge from intangible assets \\narising on acquisition and replaces the IAS 19 pension charge with the \\n‘normal’ cash contributions for pensions.\\nUse of non-GAAP profit measures – underlying profit before tax\\nThe Directors believe that underlying profit before tax and underlying \\ndiluted earnings per share measures provide additional useful information \\nfor shareholders on underlying trends and performance. These measures \\nare used for internal performance analysis. Underlying profit is not  \\ndefined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other \\ncompanies’ adjusted profit measures. It is not intended to be a substitute \\nfor, or superior to IFRS measurements of profit.\\nThe adjustments made to reported profit before tax are:\\n IAS 32 and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments’ – fair value remeasurements – •\\t\\nUnder IAS 32 and IAS 39, the Group applies hedge accounting to its \\nvarious hedge relationships when allowed under the rules of IAS 39  \\nand when practical to do so. Sometimes the Group is unable to apply \\nhedge accounting to the arrangements, but continues to enter into \\nthese arrangements as they provide certainty or active management  \\nof the exchange rates and interest rates applicable to the Group.  \\nThe Group believes these arrangements remain effective and \\neconomically and commercially viable hedges despite the inability  \\nto apply hedge accounting.\\n  Where hedge accounting is not applied to certain hedging arrangements, \\nthe reported results reflect the movement in fair value of related \\nderivatives due to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates. In \\naddition, at each period end, any gain or loss accruing on open contracts \\nis recognised in the Group Income Statement for the period, regardless \\nof the expected outcome of the hedging contract on termination. This \\nmay mean that the Group Income Statement charge is highly volatile, \\nwhilst the resulting cash flows may not be as volatile. The underlying \\nprofit measure removes this volatility to help better identify underlying \\nbusiness performance. During 2008/9, £10m (2007/8 – £nil) of the  \\nIAS 32/39 charge arose in the share of post-tax profit of joint ventures \\nand associates, with the remainder in finance income/costs. \\n IAS 19 Income Statement charge for pensions – Under IAS 19 ‘Employee •\\t\\nBenefits’, the cost of providing pension benefits in the future is discounted \\nto a present value at the corporate bond yield rates applicable on the \\nlast day of the previous financial year. Corporate bond yield rates vary \\nover time which in turn creates volatility in the Group Income Statement \\nand Group Balance Sheet. IAS 19 also increases the charge for young \\npension schemes, such as Tesco’s, by requiring the use of rates which do \\nnot take into account the future expected returns on the assets held in \\nthe pension scheme which will fund pension liabilities as they fall due. \\nThe sum of these two effects makes the IAS 19 charge disproportionately \\nhigher and more volatile than the cash contributions the Group is \\nrequired to make in order to fund all future liabilities.\\n  Therefore, within underlying profit we have included the ‘normal’ cash \\ncontributions for pensions but excluded the volatile element of IAS 19  \\nto represent what the Group believes to be a fairer measure of the cost \\nof providing post-employment benefits.\\n IAS 17 ‘Leases’ – impact of annual uplifts in rent and rent-free periods –  •\\t\\nThe amount charged to the Group Income Statement in respect of \\noperating lease costs and incentives is expected to increase significantly \\nas the Group expands its International business. The leases have been \\nstructured in a way to increase annual lease costs as the businesses \\nexpand. IAS 17 ‘Leases’ requires the total cost of a lease to be recognised \\non a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, irrespective of the \\nactual timing of the cost. The impact of this treatment in 2008/9 was  \\nan adverse charge of £27m (2007/8 – £18m) to the Group Income \\nStatement after deducting the impact of the straight-line treatment \\nrecognised as rental income within share of post-tax profits of joint \\nventures and associates. 79 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nTo find out more go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreport09\\n  Note 2 Segmental reporting\\nThe Board has determined that the primary segmental reporting format is geographical, based on the Group’s management and internal reporting \\nstructure.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at \\nwhich management monitor that goodwill.\\nRecoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. In 2008/9, recoverable amounts \\nare based on value in use. Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections for five years using data from the Group’s latest internal forecasts, the \\nresults of which are reviewed by the Board. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and \\nexpected changes in margins. Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value  \\nof money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations  \\nof future changes in the market. Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the recoverable amounts  \\nof goodwill. In the case of Japan, it is reasonably possible that a change in key assumptions would cause the goodwill to exceed its value in use. At  \\n28 February 2009, there was headroom of £8m, incorporating a long-term growth rate of 1.5% and a pre-tax discount rate of 7.3% as key assumptions.  \\nA 0.2% reduction in the long-term growth rate or a 0.2% increase in the discount rate would cause goodwill to exceed its value in use. EBITDA margin  \\nis also assumed to increase in 2009/10 from 2008/9, where a 2.9% decrease in the forecast margin for 2009/10 would also cause goodwill to exceed its \\nvalue in use. For Poland, with headroom of £84m and assuming an 11.3% pre-tax discount rate, a 0.4% increase in the discount rate would cause \\ngoodwill to exceed its value in use.\\nThe forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates of generally 2%-10% (2008: 3%-4%).\\nThe pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 7%-24% (2008: 8%-24%). On a post-tax basis, the discount rates ranged from \\n5%-19% (2008: 5%-20%). These discount rates are derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the specific  \\nrisks relating to each geographical region.\\nIn February 2009 and 2008 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the  \\ncash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. Management determined that there has been no impairment.\\nThe components of goodwill are as follows:\\n       2009 2008 \\n       £m £m\\nUK             616 571\\nTesco Personal Finance Group Limited             767 –\\nThailand             153 124\\nSouth Korea             378 48\\nJapan             196 129\\nChina             540 376\\nMalaysia             76 65\\nPoland             354 394\\nCzech Republic             47 44\\nTurkey             53 54\\nOther             5 24\\n                3,185 1,829\\nNotes to the Group financial statements continued 89 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nTo find out more go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreport09\\nNote 11 Property, plant and equipment\\n       Land and \\n       buildings Other\\n(a)\\n Total \\n       £m £m £m\\nCost\\nAt 23 February 2008           19,210 6,340 25,550\\nForeign currency translation           434 191 625\\nAdditions\\n(b) \\n          3,345 1,013 4,358\\nAcquisitions through business combinations           586 34 620\\nReclassification across categories           (305) 45 (260)\\nClassified as held for sale           (74) (8) (82)\\nDisposals           (847) (120) (967)\\nAt 28 February 2009           22,349 7,495 29,844\\nAccumulated depreciation and impairment losses\\nAt 23 February 2008           2,280 3,483 5,763\\nForeign currency translation           55 103 158\\nCharge for the year           352 659 1,011\\nReclassification across categories           (5) – (5) \\nClassified as held for sale           18 (3) 15 \\nDisposals           (128) (90) (218)\\nImpairment losses           56 – 56\\nReversal of impairment losses           (88) – (88) \\nAt 28 February 2009           2,540 4,152 6,692\\nNet carrying value\\n(c)(d)(e)\\nAt 28 February 2009          19,809 3,343 23,152\\nAt 23 February 2008           16,930 2,857 19,787\\nCapital work in progress included above\\n(f)\\n \\nAt 28 February 2009           1,375 159 1,534\\n(a)  Other assets consist of plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings and motor vehicles.\\n(b)  Includes £152m (2008 – £103m) in respect of interest capitalised, principally relating to land and building assets.

This enables the optimisation of the overall cost of accessing debt \\ncapital markets, and mitigates the market risk which would otherwise arise from the maturity and other profiles of assets and liabilities.\\nHedging policies using derivative financial instruments are further explained below. Derivatives that are held as hedging instruments are formally \\ndesignated as hedges as defined in IAS 39. Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as described below.\\nFinance costs of £30m (2008 – £nil) resulted from hedge ineffectiveness.\\nFair value hedges  \\nThe Group maintains interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued \\nby the Group. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group Income Statement, \\ntogether with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss on the hedging \\ninstrument and hedged item is recognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for \\nhedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is amortised to the Group Income Statement under the effective interest \\nrate method.\\nA gain of £1,197m on hedging instruments was recognised during the year, offset by a loss of £1,227m on hedged items (in 2008, a gain of £261m on \\nhedging instruments was offset by a loss of £261m on hedged items).\\nCash flow hedges\\nThe Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated  \\nin a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company. Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, mark-to-market gains \\nand losses are deferred in equity.\\nThe hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars. The cash flows hedged will occur and will affect the Group \\nIncome Statement within one year of the Balance Sheet date. \\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss  \\nexisting in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is recognised in the Group Income Statement. When  \\na forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Group \\nIncome Statement.\\nNet investment hedges  \\nThe Group uses forward foreign currency contracts, currency denominated borrowings and currency options to hedge the exposure of a proportion  \\nof its non-Sterling denominated assets against changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.\\nThe Group has a South Korean Won denominated liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, Samsung Tesco \\nCo. Limited. This liability has been designated as a net investment hedge of a proportion of the assets of Samsung Tesco Co. Limited.\\nThe Group has a Chinese Yuan denominated liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, Hymall.

These risks are managed as described below. The Group Balance Sheet position at  \\n28 February 2009 is representative of the position throughout the year, including the impact of acquisitions during the year.\\nRisk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board provides written \\nprinciples for risk management, as described in the Business Review on pages 38 to 40.\\nInterest rate risk\\nInterest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Debt issued at variable rates exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Debt issued at fixed \\nrates exposes the Group to fair value risk. Our interest rate management policy is explained on page 40.\\nThe Group has RPI debt where the principal is indexed to increases in the RPI index. RPI debt is treated as floating rate debt. The Group also has LPI \\ndebt, where the principal is indexed to RPI, with an annual maximum increase of 5% and a minimum of 0%. LPI debt is treated as fixed rate debt.\\nFor interest rate risk relating to Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited (TPF) please refer to the separate section on TPF financial risk factors.\\nDuring 2009 and 2008, net debt including TPF was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows:\\n     2009   2008\\n   Fixed  Floating Total Fixed  Floating Total \\n    £m £m  £m £m £m £m\\nCash and cash equivalents    – 3,509 3,509 – 1,788 1,788\\nLoans and advances to customers – TPF     3,388 – 3,388 – – – \\nLoans and advances to banks and other financial assets – TPF   – 2,129 2,129 – – –\\nShort-term investments     – 1,233 1,233 – 360 360 \\nOther investments – TPF     259 – 259 – – – \\nJoint venture loan receivables     – 262 262 – 173 173\\nFinance leases    (84) (159) (243) (73) (188) (261)\\nBank and other borrowings    (11,540) (4,667) (16,207) (5,745) (2,045) (7,790)\\nCustomer deposits – TPF     – (4,538) (4,538) – – –\\nDeposits by banks – TPF    – (24) (24) – – –\\nFuture purchases of minority interests     (200) – (200) (232) – (232)\\nDerivative effect:         \\n Interest rate swaps     (415) 415 – 752 (752) –\\n Cross currency swaps     4,524 (4,524) – 2,778 (2,778) –\\n Caps and collars    774 (774) – (876) 876 –\\nTotal     (3,294)  (7,138)  (10,432)  (3,396)  (2,566)  (5,962) \\nCredit risk  \\nCredit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, customer deposits, financial instruments and deposits with banks and \\nfinancial institutions. The Group policy on credit risk is described on page 40.\\nThe counterparty exposure under derivative contracts is £1,860m (2008 – £313m). The Group policy is to transact derivatives only with counterparties \\nrated at least A1 by Moody’s.\\nFor credit risk relating to TPF please refer to the separate section on TPF financial risk factors.\\nLiquidity risk  \\nLiquidity risk is managed by short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts. In addition, the Group has committed facility agreements for £2.7bn  \\n(2008 – £1.6bn), which mature between 2010 and 2014.\\nThe Group has a European Medium Term Note programme of £15bn, of which £11bn was in issue at 28 February 2009 (2008 – £4.9bn), plus a Euro \\nCommercial Paper programme of £2bn, of which £1.6bn was in issue at 28 February 2009 (2008 – £0.6bn), and a US Commercial Paper programme  \\nof $4bn, none of which was in issue at 28 February 2009 (2008 – £nil). \\nFor liquidity risk relating to TPF please refer to the separate section on TPF financial risk factors.\\nThe following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivatives.\\nThe undiscounted cash flows will differ from both the carrying values and fair value. Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the \\nBalance Sheet date. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at the Balance Sheet date. For index linked liabilities, inflation is \\nestimated at 3% for the life of the liability. \\nNotes to the Group financial statements continued 103 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nTo find out more go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreport09\\nNote 23 Financial risk factors continued\\n      Due  Due  Due Due  \\n     Due  between  between between between Due \\n     within  1 and 2  2 and 3 3 and 4 4 and 5 beyond \\n     1 year  years  years years years 5 years \\nAt 28 February 2009     £m  £m  £m £m £m £m\\nNon derivative financial liabilities\\nBank and other borrowings      (3,616) (971) (873) (1,931) (225) (7,943)\\nInterest payments on borrowings      (560) (549) (514) (486) (411) (5,045)\\nCustomer deposits – TPF   (4,538) – – – – –\\nDeposits by banks – TPF   (24) – – – – –\\nFinance leases       (55)  (51) (48) (32) (9) (172)\\nTrade and other payables     (8,522) (34) (5) (2) (4) (23)\\nDerivative and other financial liabilities          \\nNet settled derivative contracts – receipts     104 17 9 5 4 1\\nNet settled derivative contracts – payments     (245) (30) (19) (23) (13) (112)\\nGross settled derivative contracts – receipts     4,657 1,186 1,247 404 708 5,707\\nGross settled derivative contracts – payments     (4,577) (957) (1,053) (313) (671) (4,652)\\nFuture purchases of minority interests      (93) – (87) (20) – –\\nTotal     (17,469)  (1,389) (1,343) (2,398) (621) (12,239)\\n \\n     Due  Due  Due Due  \\n    Due  between  between between between Due \\n    within  1 and 2  2 and 3 3 and 4 4 and 5 beyond \\n    1 year  years  years years years 5 years \\nAt 23 February 2008    £m  £m  £m £m £m £m\\nNon derivative financial liabilities\\nBank and other borrowings      (2,018) (287) (795) (398) (47) (4,714)\\nInterest payments on borrowings      (298) (272) (229) (211) (198) (4,906)\\nFinance leases       (62)  (54) (50) (46) (30) (130)\\nTrade and other payables      (7,277) (14) (13) (2) (6) (7)\\nDerivative and other financial instruments          \\nNet settled derivative contracts – receipts     7 – – – – –\\nNet settled derivative contracts – payments     (230) (16) (9) (9) (9) (172)\\nGross settled derivative contracts – receipts     2,968 255 705 484 297 3,207\\nGross settled derivative contracts – payments     (2,827) (286) (677) (452) (304) (3,280)\\nFuture purchases of minority interests      –  (70) – (166) (34) –\\nTotal      (9,737)  (744)  (1,068) (800) (331) (10,002)\\nSensitivity analysis at 28 February 2009\\nFinancial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The following analysis, required by  \\nIFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates, and foreign \\nexchange risk. 104 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nNotes to the Group financial statements continued\\nNote 23 Financial risk factors continued\\nForeign exchange risk\\nThe Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk principally via:\\n(a)  Transactional exposure, from the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the \\nfunctional currency of the purchasing company. Transactional exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged. \\nThese exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges. The notional and fair value of these \\ncontracts is shown in note 22.\\n(b)  Net investment exposure, from the value of net investments outside the UK. We hedge the majority of our investments in our international \\nsubsidiaries via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are formally designated as net investment hedges.\\n(c)  Loans to non-UK subsidiaries. These are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are not formally \\ndesignated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset.\\nThe impact on Group financial instruments from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity analysis below.\\nThe analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-employment obligations and on  \\nthe retranslation of overseas net assets as required by IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’. However it does include the foreign \\nexchange sensitivity resulting from all local entity non-functional currency financial instruments.\\nThe sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and \\nderivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in \\nplace at 28 February 2009.\\nIt should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to all financial instruments held at the Balance Sheet date. \\nIt does not reflect any change in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.\\nThe following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:\\n the sensitivity of interest payable to movements in interest rates is calculated on the post hedge floating rate net debt exposure with no sensitivity •\\t\\nassumed for LPI-linked debt;\\n  changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates or foreign exchange •\\t\\nrates have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt;\\n  changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in foreign exchange rates are •\\t\\nrecorded directly in equity;\\n  changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments only affect the Group Income Statement; •\\t\\n  all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are fully effective with no impact on  •\\t\\nthe Group Income Statement;\\n  debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the interest payable part of the calculation; and •\\t\\n  the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects  •\\t\\na full 12-month period for the interest payable portion of the sensitivity calculations.\\nUsing the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and equity that would result from \\nchanges in UK interest rates, and in exchange rates:\\n        2009  2008\\n     Income Equity Income Equity \\n     gain/(loss) gain/(loss) gain/(loss) gain/(loss) \\n     £m £m £m £m\\nAssets\\n1% increase in GBP interest rates         (59) – (42) –\\n \\n25% appreciation of the Euro (2008 – 5%)         (22) (22) (5) (32)\\n20% appreciation of the South Korean Won (2008 – 5%)         (1) (222) – –\\n25% appreciation of the US Dollar (2008 – 5%)         (11) 218 (2) 43\\n25% appreciation of the Thai Baht (2008 – 5%)         – (1) – (1)\\n25% appreciation of the Czech Koruna (2008 – 10%)         – (204) – (27)\\n15% appreciation of the Polish Zloty (2008 – 15%)         14 – 1  (102)\\n20% appreciation of the Slovak Koruna (2008 – 20%)         – – 2 (87)\\nThe impact on equity from changing exchange rates results principally from foreign currency deals used as net investment hedges. The impact on equity \\nwill largely be offset by the revaluation in equity of the hedged assets. For changes in the USD/GBP exchange rate, the impact on equity results \\nprincipally from forward purchases of USD as cash flow hedges. 105 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nTo find out more go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreport09\\nNote 23 Financial risk factors continued\\nCapital risk\\nThe Group’s objectives when managing capital (defined as net debt plus equity) are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern  \\nin order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while maintaining a strong credit rating and headroom whilst optimising \\nreturn to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to \\nit, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Company.\\nTo maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, buy back shares and cancel them or issue new \\nshares. In April 2006, we outlined our plan to release cash from our property assets, via a sequence of property joint ventures and other transactions,  \\nand return significant value to shareholders, either through enhanced dividends or share buy-backs. The target for the value of share buy-backs was \\nincreased from £1.5bn to £3.0bn over a five-year period from April 2007. Whilst we continued with the policy at the beginning of 2008/9, we have \\nsubsequently used the proceeds from property divestment to pay down debt, following the two major acquisitions in the second half (Homever and \\nTesco Personal Finance Group Limited). Early in 2008/9 we purchased and cancelled £100m ordinary shares. In the financial year 2009/10 we expect  \\nto continue to use the proceeds from the sale of property to pay down debt. \\nThe policy for debt is to ensure a smooth debt maturity profile with the objective of ensuring continuity of funding. This policy continued during the \\ncurrent year with bonds redeemed of £524m and new bonds issued totalling £4,901m. The Group borrows centrally and locally, using a variety of capital \\nmarket issues and borrowing facilities to meet the requirements of each local business.\\nTesco Personal Finance Group Limited (TPF)\\nInterest rate risk\\nInterest rate risk arises where assets and liabilities in TPF’s banking activities have different repricing dates. TPF policy seeks to minimise the sensitivity \\nof net interest income to changes in interest rates. Potential exposures to interest rate movements in the medium to long term are measured and \\ncontrolled through position and sensitivity limits. Short-term exposures are measured and controlled in terms of net interest income sensitivity over  \\n12 months to a 1.5% parallel movement in interest rates. Risk is managed through arm’s length cash transactions.\\nCredit risk\\nCredit risk is the probability of customers and counterparties failing to meet their obligations to TPF and arises principally from TPF’s lending activities \\nbut also from other transactions involving on and off-balance sheet instruments. Limits have been established for all counterparties based on their \\nrespective credit ratings. The limits and proposed counterparties are reviewed and approved by the Risk Management Committee (RMC) and Board  \\nof TPF.\\nInternal reporting and oversight of risk assets is principally differentiated by credit ratings. Internal ratings are used to assess the credit quality of \\nborrowers. Customers are assigned credit ratings, based on various credit grading models that reflect the probability of default.\\nLiquidity risk \\nLiquidity risk is managed on a consolidated basis within TPF’s banking activities and adheres to the liquidity requirements set by the Financial Services \\nAuthority (FSA) from time to time. In the UK, the FSA requires TPF to be able to meet its sterling obligations without recourse to the wholesale markets \\nfor a period of at least five business days.

The Group recognises provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not a settlement will be required and the value of such a payment \\ncan be reliably estimated. \\nIn September 2007, the Office of Fair Trading issued its provisional findings in its Statement of Objections relating to the alleged collusion between  \\ncertain large supermarkets and dairy processors. We continue to defend our case vigorously. No provision has been recognised in the Group’s results.\\nTesco Personal Finance Group Limited\\nAt 28 February 2009, Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited (TPF) has commitments of formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments  \\nto lend, totalling £5.7bn. The amount is intended to provide an indication of the volume of business transacted and not of the underlying credit or  \\nother risks.\\nThe Financial Services Compensation Scheme (‘FSCS’) compensates customers of UK financial institutions when those institutions are unable to pay \\nout. Firms are being levied only for interest costs and management expenses of the scheme (and not for the capital repayments which will ultimately \\nneed to be made), but the amounts have increased significantly compared to prior years. The levy is calculated based on deposit balances held as at  \\n31 December in each year and as such, this is seen as the ‘trigger event’ under accounting rules. TPF was a market participant at 31 December 2007  \\nand 31 December 2008 and has accrued for its share of the 2008/9 and 2009/10 levy which was not material to the Group. Going forward further \\nprovisions in respect of these costs are likely, the ultimate cost of which remains uncertain.\\nNote 36 Capital resources \\nThe following table shows the composition of regulatory capital resources of Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited at the Balance Sheet date:\\n       2009 2008 \\n           £m £m\\nTier 1 capital:           \\nShareholders funds and minority interests        566 –\\nTier 2 capital:         \\nQualifying subordinated debt        205 –\\nOther interests in tier 2 capital       19 –\\nSupervisory deductions        (259) –\\nTotal regulatory capital        531 –\\nThe movement of tier 1 capital from the date of acquisition to the Balance Sheet date is analysed as follows:\\n        2009 2008 \\n            £m £m\\nAt 19 December 2008*        559 –\\nProfi t attributable to shareholders       7 –\\nAt 28 February 2009        566 –\\n* Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited was acquired on 19 December 2008.\\nIt is Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited’s (TPF) policy to maintain a strong capital base, to expand it as appropriate and to utilise it efficiently \\nthroughout its activities to optimise the return to shareholders while maintaining a prudent relationship between the capital base and the underlying \\nrisks of the business. In carrying out this policy, TPF has regard to the supervisory requirements of the Financial Services Authority (‘FSA’). The FSA  \\nuses Individual Capital Guidance (‘ICG’) as a measure of capital adequacy in the UK banking sector, comparing a bank’s capital resources with its risk-\\nweighted assets (the assets and off-balance sheet exposures are ‘weighted’ to reflect the inherent credit and other risks). TPF has complied with the \\nFSA’s capital requirements throughout the period between the date of acquisition and the Balance Sheet date. 122 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nNote 37 Leasing commitments\\nFinance lease commitments – Group as lessee\\nThe Group has finance leases for various items of plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings.

These amendments permit the \\nreclassification of financial assets in particular circumstances.  \\nThe adoption of the amendments to FRS 26 and FRS 29 has had  \\nno impact on the results or net assets of the Company.\\nStandards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective  \\nbut not expected to have a significant impact on the Company:\\nAmendment to FRS 25, ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ – Puttable •\\t\\nFinancial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation, effective \\nfor annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010.\\nAmendment to FRS 8, ‘Related Party Transactions’ to reflect changes to •\\t\\nUK law, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 6 April 2008.\\nStandards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective but \\nunder review as to their effect on the Company:\\nAmendment to FRS 20, ‘Share Based Payment’ – Vesting Conditions •\\t\\nand Cancellations, effective for annual periods beginning on or after  \\n1 January 2009. \\nAmendment to FRS 26, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and •\\t\\nMeasurement’ – Eligible hedged items, effective for annual periods \\nbeginning on or after 1 July 2009. \\nCurrent asset investments\\nThese relate to money market deposits which are stated at cost. All income \\nfrom these investments is included in the Profit and Loss Account as \\ninterest receivable and similar income.\\nInvestments in subsidiaries and joint ventures\\nInvestments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are stated at cost less,  \\nwhere appropriate, provisions for impairment.\\nForeign currencies\\nAssets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Pounds \\nSterling at the financial year end exchange rates.\\nShare-based payments\\nEmployees of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form \\nof share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services \\nin exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions) or \\nin exchange for entitlements to cash payments based on the value of the \\nshares (cash-settled transactions).\\nThe fair value of employee share option plans is calculated at the grant \\ndate using the Black-Scholes model. In accordance with FRS 20 ‘Share-\\nbased payment’ the resulting cost is charged to the Profit and Loss \\nAccount over the vesting period. The value of the charge is adjusted to \\nreflect expected and actual levels of vesting. \\nWhere the Company awards options to employees of subsidiary entities, \\nthis is treated as a capital contribution.\\nFinancial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s \\nBalance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual \\nprovisions of the instrument.\\nDebtors  \\nDebtors are non interest-bearing and are recognised initially at fair \\nvalue, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nrate method, reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated \\nirrecoverable amounts.\\nInvestments  \\nInvestments are classified as either held for trading or available-for-sale, \\nand are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. There are \\nno investments classified as held for trading. Gains and losses arising \\nfrom changes in fair value for available-for-sale investments are \\nrecognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is \\ndetermined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss \\npreviously recognised in equity is included in the net result for the period. \\nFinancial liabilities and equity  \\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to  \\nthe substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity \\ninstrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of \\nthe Company after deducting all of its liabilities.\\nInterest-bearing borrowings  \\nInterest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the \\nvalue of the amount received, net of attributable transaction costs. \\nSubsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated \\nat amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption \\nvalue being recognised in the Profit and Loss Account over the period  \\nof the borrowings on an effective interest basis.\\nCreditors  \\nCreditors are non interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.\\nEquity instruments  \\nEquity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds \\nreceived, net of direct issue costs.\\nNotes to the Parent Company financial \\nstatements \\nNote 1 Accounting policies  128 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nNotes to the Parent Company financial \\nstatements continued\\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting  \\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its \\nexposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from \\noperating, financing and investing activities. The Company does not \\nhold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, \\nhowever if derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting they are \\naccounted for as such.\\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. \\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by \\nreference to market values for similar financial instruments, by discounted \\ncash flows or by the use of option valuation models. Where derivatives do \\nnot qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement \\nare immediately recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. Where \\nderivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant  \\ngain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the  \\nitem being hedged.\\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company is required  \\nto document from inception the relationship between the item being \\nhedged and the hedging instrument. The Company is also required to \\ndocument and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between \\nthe hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the  \\nhedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness \\ntesting is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains \\nhighly effective.\\nDerivative financial instruments with maturity dates of more than one  \\nyear from the Balance Sheet date are disclosed as falling due after more \\nthan one year.\\nFair value hedging  \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when \\nthey hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a \\nrecognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that \\nare designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Profit \\nand Loss Account, together with any changes in the fair value of the \\nhedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.\\nDerivative financial instruments qualifying for fair value hedge accounting \\nare principally interest rate swaps (including cross currency swaps).\\nCash flow hedging  \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when \\nthey hedge the Company’s exposure to variability in cash flows that are \\neither attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset \\nor liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction.\\nThe effective element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative \\ninstrument is recognised directly in equity. \\nThe associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and \\nrecognised in the Profit and Loss Account in the same period or  \\nperiods during which the hedged transaction affects the Profit and  \\nLoss Account. The classification of the effective portion when recognised \\nin the Profit and Loss Account is the same as the classification of the \\nhedged transaction. Any element of the remeasurement of the derivative \\ninstrument which does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge  \\nis recognised immediately in the Profit and Loss Account.\\nDerivative instruments qualifying for cash flow hedging are principally \\nforward foreign exchange transactions and currency options.\\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires  \\nor is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. \\nAt that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging \\ninstrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted \\ntransaction occurs or the original hedged item affects the Profit and Loss \\nAccount. If a forecasted hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, \\nthe net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the \\nProfit and Loss Account.\\nNet investment hedging  \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges \\nwhen they hedge the Company’s net investment in an overseas \\noperation. The effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss \\nfrom remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in \\nequity. Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the Profit \\nand Loss Account. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included \\nin the Profit and Loss Account when the foreign operation is disposed of.\\nDerivative instruments qualifying for net investment hedging are \\nprincipally forward foreign exchange transactions and currency options.\\nPensions  \\nThe Company participates in the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme which is  \\na multi-employer scheme within the Tesco Group and cannot identify its \\nshare of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme. Accordingly, \\nas permitted by FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’, the Company has \\naccounted for the scheme as a defined contribution scheme, and the \\ncharge for the period is based upon the cash contributions payable. \\nTaxation  \\nCorporation tax payable is provided on the taxable profit for the year, \\nusing tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance  \\nSheet date.\\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have \\noriginated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date and would give  \\nrise to an obligation to pay more or less taxation in the future.\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are recoverable. \\nThey are regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all \\navailable evidence, it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be \\nsuitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying \\ntiming differences can be deducted.\\nDeferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates  \\nthat are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences \\nreverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been substantively enacted \\nby the Balance Sheet date.\\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued 129 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009\\nTo find out more go to

Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2009\\n3 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT\\nWe’ve made several new appointments to \\nthe Tesco Board in the year, including Laurie \\nMcIlwee who takes on the role of Group \\nFinance Director, replacing Andrew Higginson \\nwho has been appointed Chief Executive  \\nof Retailing Services whilst retaining his \\nresponsibility for Group Strategy. \\nLaurie has been with Tesco for nine years \\nand has a very strong track-record in both \\nfinance and operations. In his most recent \\nrole as Distribution Director Laurie was \\nresponsible for transforming our network – a \\ntremendous achievement. His appointment \\nshows once again how careful management \\nsuccession planning works in Tesco and I have \\nevery confidence he will do an outstanding \\njob as our Group Finance Director. \\nWe’ve also appointed three strong new \\nNon-executive Directors in recent months – \\nJacqueline Tammenoms Bakker, a former \\nDirector General at the Ministry of Transport \\nin the Netherlands who has also held senior \\npositions at McKinsey & Co. and Shell, \\nPatrick Cescau, former CEO of Unilever and \\nKen Hanna, Chairman of Inchcape plc and \\nformer CFO of Cadbury. They bring with \\nthem a wealth of international, commercial \\nand financial experience which will further \\nstrengthen our Board and support our plans \\nfor the long-term growth of the Group.\\nWhilst the downturn has presented many \\nchallenges, it has also opened up some \\nopportunities. We have made two very \\nsignificant acquisitions this year.\\nWe have acquired the remaining 50% of \\nTesco Personal Finance from Royal Bank  \\nof Scotland, a move which will enable us to \\ndevelop an already very successful financial \\nservices offer towards our objective of \\nbecoming a full-service retail bank.\\nIn South Korea we purchased 36 \\nhypermarkets from E-land, mostly in  \\nSeoul, which has put us in a very strong \\nposition to challenge for market leadership \\nin one of our most successful markets.\\nMost of our growth has again been organic – \\nwe’ve opened nine million square feet of new \\nspace this year, excluding the acquisition in \\nSouth Korea, and in August we announced \\nthat we are establishing a wholesale cash & \\nI am pleased to report that despite the \\nextraordinary economic environment \\nwe find ourselves in, Tesco has once \\nagain delivered a good set of results. \\nThis demonstrates that Tesco is coping \\nwell with the downturn. Despite the \\nchallenging conditions around the \\nglobe we have remained resilient and \\nare growing as fast as any major \\ninternational retailer. \\ncarry operation in India. This complements \\nour entries into China and the United States, \\ngiving us access to another of the world’s \\nmost important economies.\\nWhilst many of our customers are focused \\non managing their shopping budgets, it is \\nstill important to them that we behave \\nresponsibly in the communities we serve. \\nWe now have a Community Plan for each \\ncountry and earlier in the year we launched \\nour Community Promises. These are: \\nactively supporting local communities; \\nbuying and selling our products responsibly; \\ncaring for the environment; giving \\ncustomers healthy choices; and good  \\njobs for local people.\\nWe’ve made some great progress this year \\n– we’ve opened our greenest ever store  \\nat Cheetham Hill in Manchester, with a \\ncarbon footprint that is 70% lower than  \\na typical store – bringing our total number \\nof green stores across the Group to 37. \\nOur work to encourage customers to make \\ngreener decisions is going well. Through \\ngreen Clubcard points we have reduced  \\nthe number of single-use carrier bags in the \\nUK by 50% and we are finding innovative \\nways to use green Clubcard elsewhere –  \\nfor example by rewarding customers for \\ncycling to our stores in South Korea.\\nI’m also pleased to announce that in the \\nUK we have once again broken our ‘Charity \\nof the Year’ record, raising a remarkable  \\n£6.2 million for Marie Curie Cancer Care.\\nAlthough it was impossible to predict the \\nscale of the global economic slowdown, \\nTesco has responded well by adjusting our \\nbusiness to this environment.

Page 16\\nOur long-\\nterm strategy\\nSir Terry Leahy, Chief Executive Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2009\\n7 CHIEF Ex ECUTIv E’S Q&A\\nAt a time when customers everywhere are \\nfeeling the economic strain, we are responding \\nto their changing needs in all our markets by \\nlowering prices, introducing more affordable \\nproducts and offering even sharper promotions. \\nQ: You’re very much in the front line \\nwhen it comes to knowing what \\ncustomers are thinking, how they are \\nbehaving. Are there any signs that we \\nhave perhaps reached the bottom of  \\nthe recession? What lies in store for  \\nthe economy do you think?\\nA: It is very fluid at the moment – changes \\nare happening over weeks, so I don’t think \\nyou can see any clear direction yet. What  \\nI would say is that it looks as if things are \\nstabilising on the consumer front. In the  \\nUK the lower interest rates help, as do the \\nlower fuel prices and energy prices, and \\ncoupled with the work that we have done  \\nin reducing food prices for customers –  \\nthis helps rebuild confidence. In Central \\nEurope the economics had a big decline \\nearly in the summer and the autumn of \\n2008 – that feels as if it has levelled out, \\nwhich is encouraging. In Asia it is too early \\nto say. Their decline came later with the  \\ndestocking of the supply chain and so for \\nthem it really hit around December. These \\nare strong economies and the destocking \\nwill end and we’ll start to get restocking in \\nthe pipeline which will help.\\nQ: Priorities change during a recession \\nof course for business and customers \\nalike, is there a risk that the focus on \\ngreen and corporate responsibility slips \\nsomewhat?\\nA: It is important that it doesn’t and it’s  \\none of the reasons we lay such emphasis \\nwithin Tesco on our ‘Steering Wheel’ –  \\nour balanced scorecard – so that whatever \\nis going on in the outside world, we keep \\nfocused on the things that matter long \\nterm. Of course price and trading is \\nimportant at the moment, but there are  \\nbig long-term objectives around community \\nand the environment that we have got to \\nstay committed to. Tesco has to help \\ncustomers change from mass consumption \\nto green consumption. On climate change, \\nThese actions, combined with our core \\nstrengths – in selling food and everyday \\nessentials, owning our own property \\nand having a broad business base – are \\nhelping us to cope well with the effects \\nof the downturn. We are also pleased \\nwith the early performance of Tesco \\nPersonal Finance under our ownership \\nand with the converted Homever stores \\nin South Korea. \\n \\nAs a result, we have delivered a solid \\nsales and profit performance, both in \\nthe UK and internationally, whilst \\ncontinuing to invest in our long-term \\nstrategy for growth. We have made  \\na good start to the new financial year \\nand I am confident Tesco will continue \\nto make good progress even in the \\ncurrent global economic environment.\\nQ: It has been a very tough time for the \\neconomy but the good news is it has \\nbeen very sturdy growth for Tesco.  \\nHow have you managed that?\\nA: It has been a very good year and mainly \\nof course that is the dividend of having  \\na long-term, consistent strategy. We’ve \\ninvested into this slowdown and that has \\ngiven us good momentum through the \\nrecession. We are growing fast in our \\noverseas countries, laying out networks of \\nstores and we are still opening new space in \\nthe UK as well. In addition to that, of course, \\npeople have to eat – we’re blessed in that \\nsense, so we don’t face the worst of the \\nslowdown. We’ve also adjusted our business \\nboth in the UK and around the world to \\nmake sure that we offer better value and \\nbetter ranges which keeps customers in the \\nstores, and helps volume in the business.\\nTo see a full video interview go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreview09/presentations\\nwe’ve got to learn how to run this business \\non 80% less carbon. We have got great \\nplans and we are making great progress. \\nOf course it helps the business too – not \\nwasting things is a very good habit at a \\ntime like this and one of the reasons our \\nenergy bills are down £100 million this year \\nis because of all of the green initiatives \\nwe’ve been working on over several years.\\nQ: Bearing in mind what you have seen \\nin the US so far, are you pleased with \\nthe progress? \\nA: I am, yes, because there’s lots to be \\npleased about. Clearly nobody would have \\nchosen to open into the scale of recession \\nthat we’ve seen there, which is particularly \\nstiff in the Western United States, but the \\ncustomers love the stores and they appeal \\nright across the income range and the age \\nrange and that bodes very well for their \\nlong-term appeal. Fresh & Easy is more \\nthan just a niche retailer – it’s a new and \\ndifferent form of retailing. Customers \\nobviously like the fresh foods and they  \\nlike the own-brand products,  but also are \\nincreasingly recognising the tremendous \\nprices that are on offer and of course that  \\nis very important at the moment. The \\noperation is very good and it’s strong.  \\nWe really have created the business that  \\nwe set out to create in terms of the highest, \\nfreshest quality in the market at the best \\nprices in the local neighbourhood. We are \\nexpanding the business at a good rate and \\nmorale is high. \\nQ: What excites you most about the \\nyear ahead?\\nA: First of all we’re growing – and we’re \\nserving more customers. They have needs; \\nthey are just different needs at a time like \\nthis. It’s what Tesco is for – to stay close  \\nto customers and change as their needs \\nchange. That’s got to take a different form  \\nin different categories or in different parts  \\nof the world. It’s important you have strong, \\nconfident local leadership teams who take \\nthe responsibility to make those changes.  \\nI believe that is happening. If you look at our \\nbusinesses – whether it’s non-food, financial \\nservices or in our international markets –  \\nwe are growing strongly and we are growing \\nmarket share. There’s more that we have  \\nto do from place to place, but confidence is \\nhigh. People know what they have to do and \\nhave the authority to do it.  8\\nTesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2009\\nTHE YEAR IN REv IEW\\nLoyalty card schemes \\nWe have national loyalty card schemes based on \\nClubcard in Ireland, Malaysia, South Korea and \\nChina and pilot schemes in Slovakia, Poland, \\nThailand and Turkey.\\nEach of our markets is different so it’s up to \\nthe individual businesses to adjust their offer \\nlocally. Using customer insight allows our \\nexperienced teams on the ground to make \\ndecisions based on real customer data. \\nWe have spent many years developing our \\ncustomer insight skills, particularly through \\ndunnhumby, the consumer research \\ncompany behind our loyalty scheme, \\nClubcard. Through careful analysis of  \\nsales and loyalty card data we can better \\nunderstand what is important to our \\ncustomers. This year we have been using \\nthis unique insight across most parts of  \\nour business so we don’t have to guess \\nwhat our customers want, we know.\\nIn all our markets it’s helping us select the \\nmost important items for price-sensitive or \\ncost-conscious shoppers so we can invest  \\nin lowering prices on the most important \\nitems to help customers through tough \\neconomic times. For example, in Malaysia, \\nwe have reviewed our range of staple  \\nfoods and groceries and as a result we have \\nintroduced 27 new products to the basket, \\nwhich we know are among the most \\nimportant for customers. We now make \\nsure that we are not beaten on price for \\nthese products.\\nThis insight is also helping us to make \\nthings simpler for customers to shop in  \\nour stores. For example, in Asia we have \\nworked with our leading supplier of baby \\nmilk. By reviewing the sales data we \\ndiscovered that displaying the products by \\nbrand rather than by age was important  \\nso we are changing the layout on the \\nshelves to make it easier for customers  \\nto find the products they want. \\nAcross our markets customers are changing \\ntheir shopping habits as they are affected \\nto varying degrees by the global economic \\ndownturn. In this kind of environment,  \\nit is more important than ever to listen  \\nto customers and adapt quickly to their \\nchanging needs.\\nFor example, in the US our customers tell \\nus that they love the quality and freshness \\nof our ranges, as well as the prices and  \\nthe convenient locations of the stores. \\nHowever, the economic environment into \\nwhich we originally launched the business \\nhas markedly changed and we’ve had to \\nadapt to that. We’ve made some changes \\nto the product ranges, introduced a limited \\nnumber of promotions and special offers, \\nas well as made improvements to the \\nambience of the stores. These changes \\nhave been well-received and consequently \\ncustomer numbers per store are up by \\nmore than a third.\\nInternational\\nIt’s been another good year for our international business which  \\nnow spans 13 countries across Asia, Europe and the United States.  \\nAs customers around the world are feeling the effects of the global \\neconomic slowdown we are successfully adjusting our offer in all  \\nour markets to help customers who are feeling the pinch.\\nWhilst it is important to invest in the \\nshopping trip we are also continuing to \\ninvest for future growth. This is a strategy \\nthat has served us well in the past; for \\nexample we entered Thailand and South \\nKorea during the Asian economic crisis in \\nthe 1990s and emerged stronger once the \\neconomies started to recover. We are now \\nmarket leader in Thailand and following  \\nour acquisition of 36 hypermarkets in \\nSouth Korea we are now in a very strong \\nposition to challenge for market leadership \\nthere as well.\\nWe also announced our entry into the \\nIndian market last year. We are establishing \\na cash & carry business that will offer a \\ncomprehensive range of great value fresh \\nfood, grocery and non-food products to \\nsmall retailers, restaurants, kirana stores \\nand other business owners. We will also \\nprovide farmers and other suppliers with a \\nhighly efficient route to market. In addition, \\nwe have signed an exclusive franchise \\nagreement with Trent, the retail arm of the \\nTata Group. Trent currently operates four \\nStar Bazaar hypermarkets, with plans to \\ngrow to 50 stores over the next five years. \\nWe will supply these hypermarkets with \\nproducts, but also offer our retail expertise \\nand technical capability to support the \\ndevelopment of their business.\\nTo find out more go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreview09 9 THE YEAR IN REv IEW\\nInternational \\nsales up\\n31%\\nPhilip Clarke International and IT Director\\nWe’ve long understood that retailing  \\nis local. Each team on the ground is  \\nable to adjust our offer to each market \\nbecause customers in China, for example, \\naren’t the same as those in Poland or  \\nSouth Korea. \\nSo we’ve never tried to run the \\ninternational business from our office in \\nthe UK. In fact, we have very few expats \\nworking outside the UK – in South Korea \\njust six out of a team of 20,000 people.  \\nAs we face into some strong economic \\nheadwinds, it’s more important than ever \\nto stay close to customers and be able to \\nadapt quickly locally as their needs change. \\nWe have people in each of our markets \\nwho have a wealth of experience and  \\nare able to make the decisions that  \\nreally matter. \\nA big part of my job is about making sure \\nwe’ve got the right people in each country, \\nsharing experience around the business \\nand empowering people to do the right \\nthings for their customers. \\nHow do you run successful \\nbusinesses in so many \\ncountries? 10 THE YEAR IN REv IEW\\nMaking many small improvements in \\neverything we do is what ‘Every Little \\nHelps’ is about, because when we all  \\nwork together on the little things, it \\namounts to a great deal. It’s more \\nimportant today than it’s ever been –  \\nit keeps us focused on what matters  \\nmost to customers. \\nThey are shopping around more and  \\nprice is clearly a priority for many –  \\nso we need to put the right effort and \\ninvestment into price – but not sacrifice  \\nall the other things that are important  \\nto customers, such as not having to  \\nqueue and being able to get everything \\nthat they want. \\nSo we’ve continued to make lots of  \\nsmall improvements and they’re making  \\na big difference. For example, through  \\na number of initiatives to achieve a  \\nbetter and more efficient service at our \\ncheckouts, many more customers didn’t \\nhave to queue last year and customers \\ncontinue to rank us best for speed of \\nservice at the checkouts.\\n \\n£540m\\nin productivity savings\\nDavid Potts Retail and Logistics Director\\nIs ‘Every Little Helps’  \\nstill important? 11\\nTesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2009\\nTHE YEAR IN REv IEW\\n30% \\nAround 30% of our customers \\nbuy something from our \\n‘Discount Brands at Tesco’ \\nevery time they shop.\\n70%\\nof our products are delivered to stores in  \\nretail-ready packaging, including all of our  \\nnew ‘Discount Brands’ saving many hours  \\nof staff time re-filling shelves.\\n500 new products as part of our ‘Discount \\nBrands at Tesco’ initiative. The new range \\nmeans that every customer can have a \\nproduct to match their budget without \\ncompromising on choice or quality. It creates \\na completely new way to shop for customers \\nwho want to spend less.\\nAs well as introducing more affordable \\nproducts we have been working hard to  \\ncut prices across the store. To help us do \\nthis we have been keeping very good \\ncontrol of costs and have put more focus \\non our efficiency saving programme we  \\ncall Step-Change. This programme has \\ndelivered £540 million of productivity and \\nother savings in the year, most of which \\nhave been reinvested in improving our \\nshopping trip for customers.\\nThis programme involves many projects \\nright across the business which change the \\nway we do things to drive efficiency. Many \\nof today’s savings were conceived and \\nplanned years ago and they are a result of \\nproductivity projects that span the whole \\nbusiness, from stores and depots to the \\noffice. They range from reducing the \\namount of energy we use in our stores  \\nIt’s been a tough year for many of our \\ncustomers. Consumer confidence has fallen \\nas people worry about unemployment and \\nare struggling to manage their household \\nbudgets. Not surprisingly, there has been  \\na shift in our customers’ priorities – our \\nresearch has shown that price is ranked as \\nthe most important by a margin not seen in \\ntwo decades. Therefore we believe our job \\nis to be on the side of customers, listening \\nto them and doing what we can to help \\nthem spend less. \\nAt the time of the last recession we launched \\nvalue lines – the famous blue and white \\nstripes – so we’ve long been able to provide \\nthe cheapest grocery shop in the country, \\ndiscounters included.\\nThis recession has provided a new \\nchallenge because although customers \\ntend to shop around more for the best \\nprices when times are hard – it doesn’t \\nmean they want to compromise on quality \\nof the shopping trip or on choice. That is \\nwhy this year we made the biggest change \\nto our range in a decade, launching around \\nCore UK\\nEveryone in the business understands the way we work – to make \\nthings better for customers, simpler for staff and cheaper for Tesco.  \\nAt a time when customers are feeling the pinch and our competitors \\nhave improved, this philosophy is more important than ever.\\nto introducing better ways of working to \\nimprove our efficiency by making things \\nbetter for customers, simpler for staff and \\ncheaper for Tesco. For example, in the last \\nyear we have saved 52,000 deliveries to  \\nour stores by using larger-fill double-decked \\nvehicles, which in turn have also saved  \\n12 million road miles. \\nWe’ve also introduced innovative \\ntechnology which allows us to electronically \\ncheck-in bread and milk deliveries at our \\ndepots, eliminating substantial paperwork \\nand administration.\\nWe have picked up the pace on a number \\nof these long-term cross-functional Step-\\nChange projects and plan to deliver similar \\nsavings in the current year of around £550 \\nmillion. These savings will continue to go \\nback into improving our offer for customers. \\nMaking things better, simpler and cheaper \\nis part of our culture at Tesco and all our \\npeople are encouraged to suggest new \\nideas on how we can achieve this. \\nTo find out more go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreview09 Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2009\\n12\\n No. 5\\nTechnika is the fifth largest TV brand in the UK.\\nTHE YEAR IN REv IEW\\nalso been promoting our slow cooking \\nappliances as customers have been buying \\ncheaper cuts of meat and cooking from \\nscratch – half of all slow cookers bought in \\nthe run-up to Christmas were sold in Tesco.\\nOur online non-food business, Tesco Direct, \\ncontinues to grow rapidly, increasing sales \\nby more than 50% in the year.

Excluding petrol, like-\\nfor-like sales grew by 3.0%, with increases \\nof 2.0% and 2.7% in the third and fourth \\nquarters respectively. Adjusting for the \\nreduction in vAT rates, which came into \\neffect in early December, like-for-like \\ngrowth excluding petrol was 3.7% in the \\nfourth quarter.\\nInflation reduced during the second half and \\nour rate of growth was also impacted by a \\nsharp increase during the year in the level of \\ndowntrading by customers seeking to spend \\nless on their weekly shop. Tesco supported \\nboth of these trends by cutting prices and \\nintroducing more affordable products – \\nincluding our successful new ‘Discounter’ \\nranges. A combination of recovering \\ncompetitors and more subdued customer \\ndemand in some non-food product \\ncategories continued to hold back sales \\nprogress in the second half, although non-\\nfood sales growth remained positive overall \\nand broadly stable in like-for-like terms.\\nIncreased productivity and good expense \\ncontrol enabled us to maintain solid \\nmargins and deliver good profit growth \\ndespite these challenges, whilst also \\nabsorbing initial trading losses totalling \\naround £22m on Tesco Direct. After these \\ncosts, UK trading profit rose 12.7% to \\n£2,381m (last year £2,112m), with trading \\nmargins at 6.2%, including TPF, slightly up \\non last year. On a 52-week comparable \\nbasis, UK trading profit rose 10.7%.\\nIn December, we completed as planned the \\nacquisition of The Royal Bank of Scotland \\nGroup PLC’s 50% shareholding in Tesco \\nPersonal Finance (TPF) and on becoming a \\nsubsidiary, its results were consolidated into \\nour UK business for the final ten weeks of \\nthe financial year. During this period it \\ncontributed £163m to UK sales and made  \\na small contribution to trading profit. \\nTotal International sales grew strongly – by \\n30.6% at actual exchange rates to £17.9bn \\n(last year £13.7bn) and by 13.6% at \\nconstant exchange rates. On a 52-week \\ncomparable basis, actual and constant \\nexchange rate growth was 30.3% and \\n13.3% respectively. Sales growth slowed in \\nEurope during the second half, which \\nreflected deteriorating economic conditions \\nin a number of markets. In contrast, sales \\ngrowth in Asia accelerated, driven by the \\nacquisition of the 36 Homever stores in \\nSouth Korea at the start of the second half. \\nInternational contributed £709m to trading \\nprofit in the year (last year £636m), up \\n11.5% after charging £33m of Homever \\nintegration costs and pre-conversion \\nlosses. Before these costs, trading profit \\ngrew by 16.7%. Excluding initial US trading \\nlosses, International trading profits grew  \\nby 21.9%, or by 21.5% on a 52-week \\ncomparable basis.

Our performance \\nin Asia was particularly pleasing, \\nour business in Europe held up \\nwell despite the obvious economic \\nchallenges and I believe the start-up \\nlosses in our US business will now \\nbegin to reduce as Fresh & Easy \\nestablishes itself.\\nOur UK business had a good year. \\nBy remaining focused on helping \\ncustomers spend less and encouraging \\nloyalty with an increased investment \\nin Clubcard, our UK business has \\ndelivered a solid performance. In our \\ncore grocery operations, we’re growing \\nahead of the industry as a whole and \\nwe have been less affected by falling \\ninflation than the market at large.\\nIn Non-food we have made good \\nprogress. In the UK we achieved a \\nparticularly strong performance in \\nelectricals, entertainment and toys. \\nOur clothing range is becoming an \\ninternational success, led by our F&F \\nrange which is growing rapidly in our \\nEuropean markets and this year was \\nlaunched in four countries in Asia. \\nOur Retailing Services have grown \\nsales and profits once again. We’ve \\nalso been building the platforms for \\nfuture growth, particularly in Tesco \\nBank, which is making good progress \\nin developing its own systems and \\npeople capabilities as well as working \\non a broader product range as it \\nmoves towards becoming a full-\\nservice retail bank.\\nIn the same way that we’ve stuck \\nto our strategy in other parts of \\nthe business, we’ve also remained \\ncommitted to our work on Community \\nand the environment.

Many of the new \\nbusinesses that have been created \\nand developed over the last 13 years \\nas part of this strategy are now \\nof significant scale and highly \\nprofitable – in fact we are now \\nmarket leader in many of our \\nmarkets outside the UK. In 1997 our \\nInternational business generated \\n1.8% of the Group’s profits and we \\nhad only just entered the Retailing \\nServices markets; today these parts \\nof our business represent 22% and \\n16% of profits respectively.\\nImportantly, the strategy has \\ngiven the business momentum to \\ngrow well through the economic \\ndownturn. By continuing to invest \\nthrough the recession – in the \\ncustomer offer, in infrastructure and \\nin our people – we are now well \\nplaced to grow faster and improve \\nshareholder returns as the global \\neconomic environment improves. 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010\\nCountries \\nChina\\nCzech Republic \\nHungary\\nIndia\\nJapan\\nMalaysia\\nPoland \\nRepublic of Ireland\\nSlovakia\\nSouth Korea \\nThailand\\nTurkey\\nUnited States\\nInternational at a glance\\nOur international business has delivered a strong performance despite \\nmany of our markets feeling the impact of the global recession.\\nSales Trading profit\\nRegional results\\nSales up Trading\\nprofit up \\nNew space\\n5. 1m sq ft\\n£19.4bn £749m\\nNew stores\\n324\\n8.8% 5.6%\\nAsia\\nActual rates Constant rates\\n£m % growth % growth\\nSales (including VAT) 9,072 19.7% 15.3%\\nTrading profit 440 23.9% 18.9%\\nTrading margin 5.2% 0.2% 0.2%\\nEurope\\nActual rates Constant rates\\n£m % growth % growth\\nSales (including VAT) 9,997 (0.7)% (0.9)%\\nTrading profit 474 (4.0)% (5.7)%\\nTrading margin 5.4% (0.2)% (0.3)%\\nUS\\nActual rates Constant rates\\n£m % growth % growth\\nSales (including VAT) 354 72.7% 58.0%\\nTrading profit (165) (17.9)% (7.9)% T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 11\\nOur business\\nLifespace – our unique \\napproach in China\\ndestination providing shopping \\n(including a 100,000 sq ft Tesco \\nhypermarket), entertainment, dining \\nand leisure. \\nWe are partnering with investors to \\nshare the capital commitment on some \\nof these projects, enabling us to roll out \\nmore sites faster.\\nInternational\\nDelivering \\ngreat value for \\ncustomers\\non the quality and resilience of our \\nassets and local management teams \\nand strengthens our confidence in our \\ninternational strategy and long-term \\ngrowth prospects. \\nAsia\\nWe have delivered a strong \\nperformance in Asia despite \\nchallenging economic conditions in \\nthe region. We have grown sales and \\nprofits well – driven by new space \\nand the excellent performance of the \\nstores acquired in South Korea in \\n2008, which are now profitable. As \\neconomies generally in Asia start to \\nrecover we are seeing improving sales \\ntrends in all our businesses except \\nJapan, where economic conditions \\nremain subdued, with overall like-for-\\nlike sales for Asia turning positive in \\nthe fourth quarter. Profits in Asia grew \\nby 24% with margins strengthening \\nsignificantly in the second half (6.1% \\ncompared to 4.3% in the first half). \\nIn International we have delivered \\na resilient performance in the \\nface of challenging economic \\nheadwinds. Our businesses have \\nmade good progress – delivering \\nfor customers today and at the \\nsame time investing in the drivers \\nof future growth. Our strategy is \\nworking – and we ended this year \\nstronger than we started it.\\nEach of our businesses has adapted \\nitself to the demands of its local market \\n– with strong local management \\nteams finding ways to lower costs \\nand deliver great value for customers. \\nIncreasingly our international \\nbusinesses are also utilising the scale \\nand skill of the Tesco Group – with \\nmore international sourcing, Discount \\nBrands now in seven markets, F&F \\nclothing now in ten countries, Clubcard \\nintroduced in seven countries with \\nmore Clubcard holders internationally \\nthan in the UK – and the Tesco \\nOperating Model sharing our global \\nbest practice to the benefit of all \\nour businesses.\\nAfter a very tough first half of the year \\nwe are now seeing encouraging sales \\ntrends across almost all our markets; \\nwe saw strong improvements in like-\\nfor-like sales in the fourth quarter \\ncompared to the third. \\nWith clear signs that our international \\nmarkets are starting to recover we are \\nplanning to resume a faster pace of \\nnew space opening in the coming \\nyear. In 2009/10 we opened 5.1m sq ft \\nof new space and in 2010/11 we will \\nopen 8.5m sq ft in addition to nine \\nshopping malls in China. The \\nperformance of our International \\nbusinesses through this severe \\nrecession has provided reassurance \\nOur Asian markets offer a significant \\nlong-term opportunity. We have \\ncontinued to invest through the \\ndownturn to ensure that we will be \\nin an even stronger position as the \\neconomies recover. This year we \\nopened 3.0m sq ft of new space \\nacross the region – an increase of \\nmore than 10% – and we plan to \\nopen 4.9m sq ft next year (excluding \\nshopping malls). We have also \\ncontinued to make good progress \\ntowards developing a strong brand in \\nour most developed Asian markets \\nwith further expansion of Clubcard \\nand our Retailing Services businesses.\\nThe size and scale of China provides \\nunique challenges for a retailer but also \\noffers a huge opportunity for a business \\nprepared to show flexibility and vision. \\nOur strategy is to expand into less \\ndeveloped second and third tier cities \\nby opening hypermarkets in leading \\nshopping malls. We’ve found it hard to \\nfind locations with the right facilities in \\nsome cities – giving us an opportunity \\nto develop our own malls, to ensure they \\nare the right size, location and design \\nto meet the needs of the new \\nChinese consumer.\\nDuring the year we opened our first \\nthree Tesco Lifespace shopping malls \\nin Fushun (pictured), Qingdao and \\nQinhuangdao and we will open nine \\nmore this year. Each mall comprises \\napproximately 500,000 sq ft of retail \\nspace over five floors and is a one-stop  12 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010\\nInternational\\ncontinued \\nInvesting in \\nthe drivers of \\nfuture growth\\nWatch the video:\\nwww.tesco.com/tescoworksforme\\nThroughout the year we opened \\n63 new stores in South Korea, bringing \\nour total number of stores to 305\\nSouth Korea\\nHomeplus in South Korea delivered \\nanother very good performance this \\nyear with total sales growth of 33% \\n(including 3% on a like-for-like basis) \\nand profits up more than 50%. The \\nintegration of the former Homever \\nstores has been completed successfully, \\nahead of plan, with the stores now \\ntrading profitably with double-digit \\nlike-for-like sales growth in the fourth \\nquarter. South Korea also opened 63 \\nnew stores in the year. The acquisition \\nin 2008 has helped Homeplus grow \\nits market share and close the gap \\nwith the market leader. We opened \\nour first franchise store in February \\n2010 with more scheduled to open \\nin this financial year. South Korea is \\nour largest international business \\nwith sales of £4.5bn and profits of \\nalmost £300m. \\nThailand\\nTesco Lotus in Thailand has delivered \\na good performance – despite a \\nbackground of continued political \\nuncertainty – with double-digit \\nprofit growth on a constant exchange \\nrate basis. A strong store opening \\nprogramme has helped drive our sales \\ngrowth this year in a market in which \\nwe remain the clear market leader. \\nStrong productivity gains have enabled \\nus to make significant investments in \\nlowering prices for customers whilst \\nstill delivering good margins and \\npositive cash flow. The launch of \\nClubcard in August 2009 marked a \\nnew stage in the development of our \\nbusiness and take-up from customers \\nhas been excellent, with four million \\ncustomers signed up so far.\\nChina\\nIn China, we are laying the \\nfoundations for long-term growth, \\nwith further investments in new \\nstores, supply chain infrastructure \\nand management. We have focused \\non three regions – each with its own \\nmanagement team – and with a focus \\non expansion into second and third \\ntier cities. We opened 17 hypermarkets \\nin the year, including in our first \\nthree Lifespace shopping centre \\ndevelopments in Fushun, Qingdao \\nand Qinhuangdao, with average tenant \\noccupancy over 80% at opening. \\nWe plan to open 23 hypermarkets in \\n2010/11 of which nine will be in new \\nLifespace malls. The mall development \\nprogramme will be funded in part \\nthrough joint ventures with third-party \\ninvestors. The first such joint venture \\n– incorporating three malls – was \\nestablished in November 2009 with a \\nsyndicate of leading Asian investors.\\nMalaysia\\nOur business in Malaysia made good \\nprogress with sales growing 9% this \\nyear – increasing our market share. \\nWe continue to invest in Clubcard with \\nmore than one million customers \\nsigned up and with a dunnhumby \\nteam working with us locally to \\nprovide insight on pricing, range and \\npromotions. We grew our space by \\n11% this year but with the economy \\nstarting to show signs of recovery \\nwe plan to step this up to 27% growth \\nin 2010/11.\\nJapan\\nIn our 2008/9 Annual Report, we \\nstated that with the challenging \\nmarket conditions in Japan, we \\nhad only limited headroom on the \\ncarrying value of our Japan assets. \\nGiven the further deterioration in the \\nretail market, it became appropriate \\nto make impairments against the \\ngoodwill arising on the acquisition \\nwe made to enter the market in 2003, \\nresulting in a £131m charge to the \\nincome statement (£82m in the first \\nhalf and £49m in the second half).\\nOur team in Japan continues to \\nmake good progress in developing \\nthe business. Our new convenience \\nformat is receiving good feedback \\nfrom customers who like the focus on \\nfresh food and new features helping \\nus to differentiate our offer, such as \\nthe in-store bakery, an extensive wine \\nrange and our first 400 own-label \\nproducts – which after only a few \\nmonths already account for 10% \\nof sales.\\nIndia \\nOur early plans in India are progressing \\nwell. Our local management team is \\nhelping our franchise partner, Trent, \\nto develop its Star Bazaar hypermarket \\noperation which is currently achieving \\nlike-for-like sales of c.40% and buys \\nmore than 70% of its products from \\nTesco’s wholesale business.

Sales growth varied \\nacross the region with a good \\ncontribution from new space helping \\nsales grow in Poland and Turkey and \\nstay stable in the Czech Republic and \\nHungary. Significant price deflation \\nand cross-border shopping driven by \\nrapid movements in exchange rates \\nresulted in sales declining in Slovakia \\nand Ireland. Overall, however, the \\nsales trends are now improving; each \\nof our European businesses showed \\nan improvement in like-for-like sales \\ngrowth in the fourth quarter. \\nWe have made market share gains \\nacross our Central European markets \\nby reducing costs and lowering prices \\nfor customers and by continuing to \\ninvest in new space. Profitability in the \\nregion as a whole declined slightly \\ncompared with last year but was \\nresilient given the severity of recession. \\nWe are continuing to invest in the \\nregion, opening 1.8m sq ft of new \\nspace during the year – less than \\noriginally expected, primarily as a \\nresult of the economic environment. \\nWith the outlook improving we will \\nbe stepping up the rate of opening \\nwith a plan to add 3.1m sq ft of new \\nspace across the region in 2010/11.\\nRepublic of Ireland\\nIn Ireland we have made substantial \\nchanges to our business, which was \\nfacing the dual challenge of a severe \\nrecession and cross-border trading. By \\nintegrating more of our international \\nbrand buying with our UK business we \\nhave been able to reduce the prices \\nof 12,500 products by an average \\nof around 20%. \\nCustomers are responding \\nenthusiastically to our improved \\npricing and range; significant uplifts \\nin volumes have now offset the impact \\nof lower prices, resulting in positive \\nlike-for-like sales growth in the last \\nfew weeks of the year and a growing \\nmarket share. These changes, \\ncombined with a substantial cost \\nreduction programme, have enabled \\nTesco Ireland to deliver a steady \\nfinancial performance despite the \\neconomic headwinds and significant \\nself-imposed price deflation. The \\ncost of the exceptional restructuring \\nactivities was £33m in total for \\nthe year.\\nHungary\\nOur business in Hungary continues \\nto perform well – with sales levels \\nbeing maintained despite a very weak \\neconomy in which unemployment \\nlevels increased by more than 25% \\nand consumers were hit with a 5% \\nincrease in sales tax. We are continuing \\nto execute our strategy of investing \\nin the shopping trip for customers, \\nhelping our overall market share to \\ngrow again in the last year, further \\nconsolidating our market leadership. \\nPoland\\nIn Poland, we have had another good \\nyear with strong growth in sales and \\nprofits on a constant exchange rate \\nbasis. A good performance from the \\nconverted Leader Price stores, the \\npopularity of our Discount Brands – \\nnow in one in three baskets – and \\nour clothing range, which achieved \\nlike-for-like sales growth of more than \\n20%, have helped our business \\nmaintain positive ex-petrol like-for-\\nlike sales growth overall. The launch \\nof Clubcard in August 2009 has been \\nvery well received, with 1.8 million \\ncustomers signing up so far. \\nCzech Republic\\nIn the Czech Republic our strong \\nnew store opening programme has \\nhelped us maintain sales at levels \\nsimilar to last year and improve our \\nshare of a market affected by high \\nunemployment and price deflation. \\nOur Express and 10,000 sq ft format \\nstores continue to do well with \\npositive like-for-like sales growth, \\nbut as in most markets, growth in \\nthe larger stores remains subdued as \\ncustomers curtail their spending on \\nnon-food in the current environment. \\nThe outstanding category in non-\\nfood has been clothing with double-\\ndigit sales growth. Our flagship My \\nNarodni department store in Prague \\nwas reopened after a major refit \\nproject and we are pleased with the \\nresults to date. \\nThe first T esco \\noutside the UK \\nopened just 15 years \\nago – in Hungary With growing sales and improvements \\nin productivity, waste and distribution \\ncosts, store economics are improving \\nsteadily. Overall trading losses were in \\nline with guidance provided last year \\nand reflect the fact that Fresh & Easy \\nhas been built with the infrastructure \\nto support hundreds of stores. \\nWe expect to open new stores at a \\nrate of around one per week this year \\nwith a focus on areas where the local \\neconomy has been less severely hit \\nand where we are seeing substantially \\nstronger sales performance. One of \\nthe benefits of the downturn is a \\nslightly softer property market; we \\nare now able to buy more freehold \\nproperties and the overall cost of \\nbuilding a store has fallen by \\napproximately 20%. A combination \\nof new space and organic sales \\ngrowth means that sales growth this \\nyear will be more than 50%.\\nAlthough we do not expect losses to \\nbe much lower in 2010/11 we believe \\nthey have now peaked.\\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 15\\nOur business\\n145 Fresh & Easy \\nstores by end of \\n2009/10\\nAsia\\n1,230\\nEurope\\n954\\n US\\n145\\nInternational stores\\nSlovakia\\nIn Slovakia, the overall retail market \\nhas been very challenging with rising \\nunemployment and sharp falls in \\nindustrial output.

As with any of our \\nnew businesses, we are adapting and \\nimproving our offer in response to \\ncustomer feedback. During the year \\nwe’ve broadened the range in some \\nkey categories – like cereals and pet \\nfood – and added larger pack sizes \\nfor families. We have also introduced \\na range of lower-priced house brands \\nto help families on a budget.\\nWith the improvements to our range \\nimplemented and with the number \\nof stores growing (145 stores by end \\nof 2009/10), we launched media \\ncampaigns – in September 2009 and \\nJanuary 2010 – focusing on how \\nFresh & Easy can offer both high \\nquality and low prices.

We are \\ngrowing faster than the industry \\nas a whole and we have achieved \\nthis by remaining focused – as \\nalways – on customers. \\nOur strategy of earning their loyalty \\nby helping them to spend less – with \\nlow prices and affordable new products \\nsuch as the Discount Brands – deflated \\nsales growth initially but it was the \\nright thing to do for customers. By \\nencouraging and rewarding loyalty – \\nthrough an increased investment \\nin Clubcard – we have maintained \\nsteadier sales growth during the year \\nthan the industry as a whole, which \\nhas seen a significant slowdown with \\nthe steep decline in inflation.\\nExcluding petrol and adjusting for \\nVAT, like-for-like sales were 3.7% in \\nthe first half and 2.7% in the second \\nhalf, driven by a strong volume \\nperformance. Achieving our target of \\nopening 2m sq ft of new space during \\nthe year ensured that sales from new \\nspace made a good contribution to \\ntotal sales growth, which was 6.5% \\nfor the first half and 5.7% for the \\nsecond half (excluding petrol and \\nadjusted for VAT). \\nDelivering for customers through \\nrecession is not just about lowering \\nprices and offering great promotions; \\nit’s about delivering all elements of \\nthe shopping trip. Consequently, we \\nhave continued to invest in availability, \\nservice, range and quality with \\npleasing results:\\nAvailability\\nAvailability has improved again this \\nyear as a result of a number of \\ninitiatives to improve stock \\nmanagement including more \\nefficient ordering systems, a greater \\nfocus on clearing promotional and \\ndiscontinued lines, better in-store \\nmonitoring processes and storing \\nstock on the top of shelves on the \\nshop floor rather than in the \\nwarehouse. The results have not \\nonly increased availability based on \\nour dotcom picking measure and \\nreduced evening gaps in fresh food \\nby 18%, but the resulting reduction \\nin stock across our store network has \\nmade a significant contribution to our \\nimproved working capital position.\\nService\\nService remains a key differentiator. \\nOur one-in-front initiative – where if \\nthere is more than one customer \\nqueuing at a single checkout we open \\nanother – and increased investment \\nin self-service checkouts, which now \\naccount for a quarter of all transactions, \\ncontinue to keep us ahead of the \\nindustry on customer measures of \\ncheckout service. We trained more \\nthan 200,000 staff to help them \\nrespond better to customer needs and \\nour ‘Every Comment Helps’ initiative, \\nwhich encourages customers to give \\ninstant feedback via text or email, has \\ngiven us the benefit of 60,000 \\ncustomer comments to help us \\nimprove our offer and service. \\nRange\\nTesco’s diverse and adaptable range \\nallows us to offer a wide choice for \\nevery customer whatever their \\nbudget. Through the recession we \\nhave helped customers with lower-\\npriced ranges such as Discount \\nBrands and Market Value and we \\nhave also offered them affordable \\ntreats such as the Finest Restaurant \\nCollection ready meals, which have \\nbeen very popular. We continue to \\ninnovate our range with over 2,600 \\nnew or improved own-label food lines \\nlaunched this year. As the economy \\nstarts to emerge from recession we \\nare seeing customers buy more from \\nour Finest range, which returned to \\npositive like-for-like sales growth in \\nthe year.\\n2,600 new or \\nimproved own-label \\nfood lines launched \\nthis year\\n200,000 staff \\ntrained in ‘Every \\nlittle helps’ skills Watch the video:\\nwww.tesco.com/tescoworksforme\\n18 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010\\nAt Tesco we’re constantly striving to \\nmake things better, simpler and cheaper. \\nThat’s why we’ve launched three \\ninnovative and popular iPhone apps. \\nCustomers no longer have to worry \\nabout forgetting their Clubcard as \\nour latest app enables them to scan \\ntheir Clubcard on their iPhone. \\nThis app is proving extremely popular \\nwith customers with over 200,000 \\ndownloads in the first three weeks \\nand there will soon be versions for \\nother smartphones too.\\nStore Finder app enables customers to \\nfind their nearest stores and then locate \\nproducts (complete with prices) within \\nthe store – to the exact aisle. \\nOur wine app allows customers to take \\na photo of a wine they like and uses \\nimage recognition software to identify \\niPhone apps – making life easier \\nfor customers\\nthe wine, providing full product \\ninformation and allowing customers \\nto order from their phone.\\nComing soon is another tesco.com \\napp which will enable customers to do \\ntheir tesco.com grocery ordering from \\ntheir phone.\\nCore UK\\ncontinued \\nDelivering an \\n ‘Every little helps’ \\nshopping trip\\nQuality\\nQuality – particularly in fresh food – \\nremains important to customers even \\nin tough times and as we emerge \\nfrom recession this will become even \\nmore important. That’s why we have \\nbeen investing in our fresh food offer \\nwith a wide-ranging change \\nprogramme. Improved technical \\nstandards, additional specialist staff \\ntraining, closer relationships with our \\nsuppliers and significant changes to \\nthe way we merchandise some key \\nproducts are helping us deliver a \\nstronger range and better shopping \\nexperience for customers. These and \\nother initiatives helped Tesco win the \\n‘Fresh Produce Retailer of the Year’ \\nAward in 2009.\\nStep Change\\nOur UK Step Change programme \\nis in its thirteenth year and continues \\nto go from strength to strength. \\nThis year we met our £550m savings \\ntarget. Step Change is not just about \\ngenerating savings – each project must \\nbe ‘better’ for customers, ‘simpler’ for \\nstaff and ‘cheaper’ for Tesco. Our stock \\nreduction programme is an excellent \\nexample of this:\\n•  it’s better for customers because \\nit has driven a large improvement \\nin availability for both food and \\nnon-food; \\n•  it’s simpler for staff because it is \\nnow easier to locate stock to fill \\nthe shelves and stock errors can \\nbe identified more easily; and\\n•  it’s cheaper for Tesco because \\nstores now hold less stock and \\nfewer hours are needed to replenish \\nthe shelves. For example, a typical \\nTesco Extra now holds 8% less \\nstock and we are now looking at \\nreleasing backroom space which \\ncan be redeployed for Retailing \\nServices or Non-food. \\nThis year we aim to complete a \\nglobal programme that will deliver \\nsavings of £800m and we’ll invest \\nmost of these savings back into our \\noffer for customers. \\nNew space\\nThrough the experience and \\nexpertise of our property teams we \\nhave developed over a number of \\nyears a good pipeline of new space \\nopportunities.

Bad debt levels \\nrose during the year but have now \\nstabilised and throughout have \\nremained below industry averages. \\nWe have absorbed additional costs as \\nwe begin the process of moving the \\nbusiness onto its own infrastructure \\nand build the team as we prepare the \\nbusiness for faster growth. \\nCommercial performance\\nWe grew the number of customer \\naccounts by more than 400,000 in \\nthe last year – to a total of more than \\n6.2 million across all products. We \\nhave achieved double-digit customer \\ngrowth in our banking products, \\nincluding 27% growth in personal \\nloans. In insurance we held our \\nnumber of policies broadly flat in a \\nvery competitive market; the number \\nof motor insurance policies declined \\n– partly as a result of a planned \\nreduction in our exposure to high-risk \\ndrivers – but the number of policies \\nin home, pet and life insurance \\nincreased.

Profit before tax was \\n£114m – with the primary deduction \\nfrom operating profit being the \\npreviously announced £127m non-\\ncash amortisation of intangibles \\narising on acquisition. This profit \\nperformance was achieved after an \\nincrease in operating costs – as a \\nresult of the change of ownership as \\nthe business prepares for expansion \\n– and against the background of a \\n32% increase in bad debts – to £177m \\nwhich was in part offset by a credit \\nrelating to the unwind of the fair value \\nadjustment created on acquisition.\\nCapital and liquidity\\nThe Tier 1 capital ratio at the end \\nof 2009/10 was 13.0%.

We know that by managing \\nour people well – in a culture of \\ntrust and respect – they will in turn \\ntry their hardest for customers. \\nBy offering competitive pay and \\nbenefits and an opportunity to \\ndevelop a long-term varied career \\nwith good training, we are able to \\nkeep our people motivated, committed \\nand excited about working at Tesco. \\nIn the UK, for example, in our internal \\n‘Viewpoint’ staff survey this year, \\nwe improved on 24 out of the \\n25 measures and attendance levels \\nimproved again, putting an additional \\nfour million hours into our stores \\nand depots.\\nRewards and benefits\\nOur people are crucial to our \\nsuccess and it is essential that \\nthey feel rewarded for the work \\nthey do and supported in their \\ndevelopment. We offer good pay \\nacross all our businesses, as well as \\nbenefits in each market that reflect \\nemployees’ priorities. \\nDespite the tough global market in \\n2009 we continued to invest in pay \\nat the annual review. We focused \\non our core rates and in a tough \\nfinancial year our pay competitiveness \\nimproved in most markets.\\nIn many developing markets, \\nemployees place most value on good \\nbasic pay and being paid fairly for \\novertime and these are our priorities. \\nIn Malaysia, for example, where there \\nis no legal minimum wage, the \\nminimum a Tesco employee will \\nreceive is 30% more than the Poverty \\nLine Index. In Thailand this year we \\nintroduced a staff discount linked \\nto Clubcard.\\nIn the UK, our reward package leads \\nthe market on pay and benefits. We \\nare one of the few FTSE businesses \\nto still have an open defined benefit \\npension scheme, which is greatly \\nvalued by staff. We regularly offer \\nstaff the opportunity to experience \\nour brand. For example, we offer staff \\ngreat deals on our Retailing Services \\n– Tesco Mobile offers exclusive staff \\ntariffs and Tesco Bank offers deals on \\nHome Insurance, Life Insurance and \\nTravel Money – which not only reward \\nour staff but encourage them to \\nbecome advocates for our services. \\nThrough share ownership and share \\nincentive schemes, 195,000 of our \\npeople have a personal stake in Tesco. \\nEmployees were awarded shares \\nworth a record £98m last May \\nthrough our Shares In Success \\nscheme.

These were helped \\nby the fact that Tesco Bank was fully consolidated in 2010 and \\naccounted for as a joint venture for most of 2009.\\nGroup operating profit rose by 10.7% to £3,457m.

Net debt has \\nconsequently reduced by £1.7bn to £7.9bn.\\nExcluding the effects of currency fluctuations, we expect to reduce \\nnet debt to £7.5bn by the end of the 2010/11 financial year.\\nThe strength of our property-backed balance sheet was \\nfurther demonstrated with profitable market-leading sale and \\nleaseback transactions.\\nGroup capital expenditure was £3.1bn (last year £4.7bn). This reduced \\nlevel of spend was achieved whilst still delivering 8% growth in \\nGroup selling space. This year we plan to invest around £3.5bn in \\ncapital expenditure.\\nExcluding Tesco Bank, cash flow from operating activities totalled \\n£5.4bn (£5.1bn in 2009), including a £0.6bn improvement in \\nworking capital.\\nFinance costs and tax Net finance costs, after net favourable IFRS \\nadjustments of £103m*, reduced to £314m (£356m last year on a \\nconsistent 52-week basis). A reduction in the underlying interest \\ncharge is expected next year. Total Group tax has been charged at \\nan effective rate of 26.4% (last year 26.7%). We expect the tax rate \\nin 2010/11 to be around 26%.\\nDividend Underlying diluted earnings per share increased by 9.2% \\nto 16.62p in the second half, calculated using a constant tax rate. The \\nBoard has approved a final dividend of 9.16p per share, taking the full-\\nyear dividend to 13.05p. This represents an increase of 9.1% on last \\nyear’s full-year dividend which is in line with the growth in underlying \\ndiluted earnings per share at constant exchange rates. The final \\ndividend will be paid on 9 July 2010 to shareholders on the Register \\nof Members at the close of business on 30 April 2010.\\nProperty We are continuing to release value created through the long-\\nterm development of our property portfolio. In the year we completed \\ndeals with total proceeds of £1.8bn and we expect to divest a similar \\namount this year. The strong demand for these assets and the good \\nyields achieved (initial yields between 5.0% and 5.2% for stores) \\ndemonstrate the strong underlying value of our property and the \\nstrength of the Tesco covenant. Profits from property in the year were \\n£377m. Our property mix remains strong – over 70% of our property is \\nfreehold – supported by substantial new capital investment in freehold \\nassets each year. Our latest property assets valuation of £34.6bn \\nreflects recent firming yields across the market and confirms that our \\nassets are worth well in excess of their book value.\\nPension Our award-winning defined-benefit career-average pension \\nscheme is an important part of our competitive benefits package, \\nwhich helps Tesco recruit and retain the best people. In the UK we have \\n160,000 employees in the scheme. As at February 2010, under the \\nIAS\\xa019 methodology of pension liability valuation, the scheme had a \\ndeficit on a post-tax basis of £1.3bn, compared to £1.4bn at the half \\nyear. The last actuarial valuation of the scheme’s assets and liabilities \\nshowed a small and manageable deficit.\\nReturn on capital employed We have continued to invest during \\nthe recession, which has put pressure on returns in the short term but \\nis enabling us to make good progress in all our markets.

The real \\nchallenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to \\ndevelop and monitor appropriate controls. A successful risk management \\nprocess balances risks and rewards and relies on a sound judgement of \\ntheir likelihood and consequence. The Board has overall responsibility for \\nrisk management and internal control within the context of achieving the \\nGroup’s objectives. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set \\nout in more detail from page 49 of the Corporate Governance section of \\nthe Annual Report and Financial Statements. The key risks faced by the \\nGroup and relevant mitigating factors are set out below.\\nBusiness strategy If our strategy follows the wrong direction or is not \\neffectively communicated then the business may suffer. We need to \\nunderstand and properly manage strategic risk in order to deliver long-term \\ngrowth for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Our strategy is based on  \\nfive elements: to become a successful international retailer, to grow the \\ncore UK business, be as strong in non-food as in food, develop retailing \\nservices and put the community at the heart of what we do. Pursuit of this \\nfive-part strategy has allowed the business to diversify and, at a strategic \\nlevel, diversification and pursuit of growth in emerging markets have the \\neffect of reducing overall risk by avoiding reliance on a small number of \\nbusiness areas. However, by its very nature, diversification also introduces \\nnew risks to be managed in areas of the business that are less mature and \\nless fully understood.\\nTo ensure the Group continues to pursue the right strategy, the Board \\ndiscusses strategic issues at every Board meeting and dedicates two full \\ndays a year to reviewing the Group’s strategy. The Executive Committee \\nalso discusses strategy on a regular basis. We have structured programmes \\nfor engaging with all our stakeholders including customers, employees, \\ninvestors, suppliers, government, media and non-governmental \\norganisations. We also invest significant resources in ensuring our strategy \\nis communicated well and understood by the parties who are key to \\ndelivering it. The business operates a Steering Wheel (a balanced scorecard \\nprocess whereby we set goals for different areas of the business and assess \\nour overall progress on a quarterly basis) in all countries and significant \\nbusiness units to help manage performance and deliver business strategy.\\nFinancial strategy and Group treasury risk The main financial risks of \\nthe Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the \\nrisk of default by counterparties to financial transactions and fluctuations \\nin interest and foreign exchange rates. The risks associated with operating \\nTesco Bank are covered under Financial services risks below.\\nThe Treasury function is mandated by the Board to manage the financial \\nrisks that arise in relation to underlying business needs. The function has \\nclear policies and operating parameters, and its activities are routinely \\nreviewed and audited. The function does not operate as a profit centre and \\nthe undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. A description \\nof the role of the Finance Committee, Internal Audit and External Audit is \\nset out in the Corporate Governance section on page 50.\\nFinancial services risks Through Tesco Bank, the Group is subject to \\ncertain risks relating to the personal financial services industry in the UK. \\nTesco Bank is subject to significant legislative and regulatory oversight.  \\nIn particular, Tesco Bank is subject to supervision by the Financial Services \\nAuthority (FSA) which has substantial powers of intervention and requires \\nit to satisfy certain capital adequacy and liquidity ratios. If Tesco Bank is \\nunable to or fails to satisfy these ratios in the future it could lose its licence \\nand, consequently, its ability to transact business.\\nTesco Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesco on 19 December \\n2008. In preparation for this change its risk management and treasury \\ncapabilities were materially strengthened. All policies pertaining to risk \\nwithin the Bank are now subject to Tesco Bank specific governance \\nprocedures which are owned by the Tesco Bank Board. \\nTesco Bank has a banking business, predominantly in the UK, with the \\nthree main products being credit cards, unsecured personal loans and \\nsavings. It has also developed a significant insurance business, with motor, \\nhome and pet insurance being the main products.\\nTesco Bank is subject to various risks associated with the provision of \\nfinancial services. In relation to its insurance business Tesco Bank may \\nexperience a concentration of risks from natural or man-made disasters.  \\nIn addition market conditions may not allow it to purchase the amount  \\nof re-insurance it considers necessary on terms it considers acceptable. \\nActual claims may exceed the claims provisions that have been made on \\nthe basis of past experience. Tesco Bank’s credit card receivables and \\npersonal loan portfolio may be subject to changes in credit quality, due  \\nto a general deterioration in economic conditions or to failures in its credit \\nassessment process, which could adversely impact its ability to recover \\namounts due. Furthermore, there is significant competition in the financial \\nservices industry which could adversely affect Tesco Bank’s profitability. \\nLegal developments, changes in legal interpretation or precedent and \\nchanges in public policy may result in new risks emerging in addition to \\nthose anticipated.\\nTesco Bank is in the process of building new banking and insurance \\nsystems and until these are complete there is an increased element  \\nof operational risk as most operations are outsourced to Royal Bank of \\nScotland. Tesco Bank retains the risk to its insurance activities posed  \\nby external factors, such as a large weather-related event. \\nTesco Bank is an FSA-regulated entity and so its treasury function is run \\nindependently from the rest of the Group. Tesco Bank’s treasury risks \\ninclude liquidity risk and interest rate risk (in particular, in the interest rate \\nmargin realised between lending and borrowing costs). Tesco Bank  \\nis also subject to the risk of unexpected losses arising from operational \\nfailure, whether as a result of human error, systems failures, fraud or \\ninadequate controls.\\nTesco Bank monitors these risks through its governance structures, assessing \\nany potential impact and action required to manage them. The work of the \\nRisk Committee focuses on systemic risks such as funding, credit risk and \\nrisks in the insurance business, while the Tesco Bank Audit Committee \\nconsiders internal controls and assurance. \\nOperational threats and performance risk in the business There is a \\nrisk that our business may not deliver the stated strategy in full, particularly \\nsince, like all retailers, the business is susceptible to economic downturn \\nthat could affect consumer spending. The continuing acquisition and \\ndevelopment of property sites also forms an intrinsic part of our strategy \\nand this carries inherent risks. 42 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010\\nRisks and uncertainties continued\\nWe aim to deliver what customers want better than our competitors by \\nunderstanding and responding to their needs. All of our business units \\nhave stretching targets based on the Steering Wheel and the performance \\nof business units is monitored continually and reported regularly to the \\nBoard. We manage the acquisition and development of our property  \\nassets carefully. We consider and assess in detail every site at each stage  \\nof acquisition and development and ensure that relevant action is taken  \\nto minimise any risks.\\nCompetition and consolidation The retail industry is highly competitive. \\nThe Group competes with a wide variety of retailers of varying sizes and \\nfaces increased competition from UK retailers as well as international \\noperators in the UK and overseas. \\nFailure to compete with competitors on areas including price, product \\nrange, quality and service could have an adverse effect on the Group’s \\nfinancial results.\\nWe aim to have a broad appeal on price, range and store format in a way \\nthat allows us to compete in different markets. We track performance \\nagainst a range of measures that customers tell us are critical to their \\nshopping trip experience and we constantly monitor customer perceptions  \\nof ourselves and our competitors to ensure we can respond quickly if we \\nneed to.\\nPeople capabilities Employees are our greatest asset. It is critical to our \\nsuccess to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best people with the \\nright capabilities at all levels of operations. We review our people policies \\nregularly and are committed to investing in training and development and \\nincentives for our people. Our ‘Talent Planning’ process helps individuals \\nachieve their full potential. We also carry out succession planning to ensure \\nthat the future needs of the business are considered and provided for. \\nThere are clear processes for understanding and responding to employees’ \\nneeds through our People Matters Group, staff surveys, regular performance \\nreviews, involvement of trade unions in relevant markets and regular \\ncommunication of business developments. We take a proactive approach \\nto encouraging diversity at all levels within the business.\\nReputational risk As the largest retailer in the UK, expectations of the \\nGroup are high. Failure to protect the Group’s reputation and brand could \\nlead to a loss of trust and confidence. This could result in a decline in the \\ncustomer base and affect the ability to recruit and retain good people.\\nLike other companies we must consider potential threats to our reputation \\nand the consequences of reputational damage. Emotional loyalty to the \\nTesco brand has helped us diversify into new areas like retail services and \\nnon-food and we recognise the commercial imperative to do the right \\nthing for all our stakeholders and avoid the loss of such loyalty. The  \\nTesco Values are embedded in the way we do business at every level  \\nand our Group Code of Business Conduct guides our behaviour in our \\ndealings with customers, employees and suppliers.\\nWe engage with stakeholders in every sphere to take into account their \\nviews and we try to ensure our strategy reflects them. Since the launch  \\nof the Community Plan in 2006 we have demonstrated our commitment \\nto tackling a wide range of societal and environmental issues. We have \\nhigh level committees, including the Executive Committee, Corporate \\nResponsibility Committee and Group Compliance Committee to help \\nguide and monitor our policies.\\nEnvironmental risks The main environmental risk we face is the threat \\nof climate change and it is essential that we work to mitigate it through \\nenergy efficiency, the sustainable management of other resources and \\nwaste minimisation. We engage with key stakeholders and experts in \\ndeveloping environmental policy, including through the Sustainable \\nConsumption Institute we have endowed at Manchester University. \\nEnvironmental strategy and policies are reviewed regularly by the \\nCorporate Responsibility Committee. Our climate change strategy is driven \\nby a belief that proactive environmental performance will be rewarded by \\nconsumers and that providing the means by which consumers can adopt \\nlow-carbon lifestyles will increasingly be a route to competitive advantage.\\nProduct safety The safety and quality of our products is of paramount \\nimportance to Tesco as well as being essential for maintaining customer \\ntrust and confidence. A breach of confidence could affect the size of our \\ncustomer base and hence financial results.\\nWe have detailed and established procedures for ensuring product \\nintegrity at all times, especially for our own-label products. There are  \\nstrict product safety processes and regular management reports. We  \\nwork in partnership with suppliers to ensure mutual understanding of  \\nthe standards required. We also monitor developments in areas such as \\nhealth, safety and nutrition in order to respond appropriately to changing \\ncustomer trends and new legislation. We have clear processes for crisis \\nmanagement, pulling together expert teams should we need to respond \\nquickly on issues.\\nHealth and safety risks The safety of our staff and customers is of the \\nutmost importance to us. If we are unable to provide safe environments  \\nfor our staff and customers this could lead to injuries or loss of life.\\nWe operate stringent health and safety processes in line with best  \\npractice in our stores, distribution centres and offices which are monitored \\nand audited regularly. KPIs for health and safety help prevent incidents \\nand form an intrinsic part of our Steering Wheel across the business. \\nPerformance against these KPIs is reported quarterly. Our Group \\nCompliance Committee and the Compliance Committees in our business \\nunits monitor the level of compliance with both health and safety laws  \\nand our internal policies on a regular basis.\\nEthical risks in the supply chain Millions of people around the world \\nwork directly for suppliers to Tesco and the supply chain is made of \\ncomplex relationships – from individual farmers and growers through  \\nto processors, manufacturers and distributors. At the heart of our Values  \\nis our belief that we should treat people as we like to be treated and we \\nhave a responsibility to help workers in our supply chain enjoy fair labour \\nstandards. We therefore require our suppliers to meet strict criteria on \\nlabour standards, and as a founder member of the Ethical Trading Initiative \\n(ETI ), we expect all our suppliers to follow the ETI Base Code and guarantee \\ntheir workers the rights set out within it. There is, however, a risk that any \\npart of the supply chain might not adhere to these high standards. T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 43\\nOur business\\nTo minimise this risk we only work with suppliers who can demonstrate \\nthat they are committed to the ETI Base Code and share our Values. We \\nuse Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX) to carry out risk assessment \\nof all our direct suppliers and all medium and high-risk suppliers must \\nundergo an extensive, independent ethical audit. We continue to operate  \\na comprehensive programme of audit improvements, including more \\nunannounced audits and an industry-leading Auditor Recognition \\nprogramme. We have also sought to involve more multi-stakeholder \\nrepresentatives on our audits to improve workforce engagement and \\nenable activists to see and give feedback on our approach. We work with \\nsuppliers to identify any problems and, where they exist, support suppliers \\nin taking action to improve standards for their workers.\\nWe have invested heavily in building the labour standards capabilities of \\nour suppliers and our own commercial teams in the last year, including \\nrolling out extensive training to help them identify and avoid issues before \\nthey arise. We also work with businesses, governments, non-governmental \\norganisations (NGOs) and others to tackle complex and systemic problems \\nthat we cannot solve on our own. As well as having a key role in the ETI we \\nalso work closely with the Global Social Compliance Programme and other \\ngroups in specific industries and regions.\\nFraud and compliance As the business grows in size and geographical \\nspread, the risk of the occurrence of fraudulent behaviour by our \\nemployees increases. Whilst the vast majority of our staff are completely \\nhonest, there remains the potential for fraud and other dishonest activity \\nat all levels of the business, from the shop floor to senior management.\\nThe Group takes extensive steps to reduce this risk. Relevant accounting \\nand other procedures and controls at all levels are clearly set out and \\naudited across the business to reduce the risk of fraud. The Group gives \\nclear guidance on behaviour to employees through the Tesco Values and \\nthe Group Code of Business Conduct. Internal Audit undertakes detailed \\ninvestigations into all areas of the business and highlights its findings  \\nto the Audit Committee. The Compliance Committee formulates and \\nmonitors the implementation of, and compliance with, appropriate policies \\non key areas of ethical behaviour, including fraud.\\nProperty We have stretching targets for delivering new space in all of our \\nmarkets and may face challenges in finding suitable sites and obtaining \\nplanning or other consents to enable sites to be acquired and developed. \\nThe complexity of many of our property developments is increasing, \\nespecially the growing number of malls and mixed-use schemes. We also \\nhave to comply with design and construction standards which vary \\nsignificantly from country to country.\\nOur Property Acquisition Committee and other related committees in  \\nthe UK, Europe, Asia and the US closely control all aspects of the property \\nacquisition, planning and construction processes to ensure that applicable \\nstandards are met and financial risks are minimised. Our Group and \\ncountry Compliance Committees also monitor compliance with applicable \\nlegal and regulatory requirements in all aspects of our property activities.\\nNon-food risks As the proportion of our business represented by \\nnon-food products increases, there is a risk that a downturn in consumer \\nconfidence may affect the level of demand for products which consumers \\nmay regard as non-essential. \\nWe make every effort to ensure that our non-food products are \\ncompetitively priced and offer a broad range of products ranging from \\nvalue to the luxury end of the market in order to cater for the needs of  \\nas wide a range of customers as possible.\\nIT systems and infrastructure The business is dependent on efficient \\ninformation technology (IT) systems. Any significant failure in the IT \\nprocesses of our retail operations (e.g. barcode scanning or supply chain \\nlogistics) would impact our ability to trade. We recognise the essential  \\nrole that IT plays across our operations in allowing us to trade efficiently \\nand achieve commercial advantage through implementing IT innovations  \\nthat improve the shopping trip for customers and make life easier for \\nemployees. We have extensive controls in place to maintain the integrity \\nand efficiency of our IT infrastructure and we share systems from across \\nour international operations to ensure consistency of delivery.\\nRegulatory, political and economic environment We are subject to a \\nwide variety of regulations in the different countries in which we operate \\nbecause of the diverse nature of our business. Tesco may be impacted by \\nregulatory changes in key areas such as planning laws, trading hours and \\ntax rules as well as by scrutiny by the competition authorities who have \\nbeen carrying out enquiries in the UK, Ireland and elsewhere. We may also \\nbe impacted by political developments and the economic environment in \\nthe countries in which we operate. We consider these uncertainties in the \\nexternal environment when developing strategy and reviewing performance. \\nWe remain vigilant to future changes. As part of our day-to-day operations \\nwe engage with governmental and non-governmental organisations to \\nensure the views of our customers and employees are represented and try \\nto anticipate and contribute to important changes in public policy wherever \\nwe operate.\\nActivism and terrorism A major incident or terrorist event incapacitating \\nmanagement, systems or stores could impact on the Group’s ability to \\ntrade. In addition to contingency plans, we have security systems and \\nprocesses that reflect best practice.\\nPension risks The Group’s pension arrangements are an important part \\nof our employees’ overall benefits package. We see them as a strong \\ncontributor to our ability to attract and retain good people. Since the \\nimplementation of IAS 19 there is a risk that the accounting valuation \\ndeficit (which is recorded as a liability on the Group Balance Sheet)  \\ncould increase if returns on corporate bonds are higher than the \\ninvestment return on the pension scheme’s assets. The Group has \\nconsidered its pension risks and has taken action by reducing risk in  \\nits investment strategy.\\nFinancial review\\nThe main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability  \\nof funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties  \\nto financial transactions, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange  \\nrates and credit rating risks. These risks are managed as described below.  \\nThe Group Balance Sheet position at 27 February 2010 is representative  \\nof the position throughout the year.\\nFunding and liquidity The Group finances its operations by a \\ncombination of retained profits, long and medium-term debt, capital \\nmarket issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. The \\nobjective is to ensure continuity of funding. The policy is to smooth the \\ndebt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to \\nmaintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and a strong credit \\nrating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. Tesco Group \\nhas a long-term rating of A3 with a negative outlook by Moody’s and A-  \\nby Standard & Poor’s. New funding of £2.3bn was arranged during the \\nyear, including a net £1.8bn from property transactions and £0.5bn from \\nlong-term debt. At the year end, net debt was £7.9bn (last year £9.6bn). 44 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010\\nRisks and uncertainties continued\\nInterest rate risk management Our objective is to limit our exposure to \\nincreases in interest rates while retaining the opportunity to benefit from \\ninterest rate reductions. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, \\ncaps and collars are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating \\nrate debt.\\nOur policy is to fix or cap a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt \\ninterest costs of the Group excluding Tesco Bank. At the year end, £5.6bn  \\nof debt was in fixed rate form (2009 – £6.3bn) with a further £0.1bn of  \\ndebt capped or collared, therefore 72% (2009 – 72%) of net debt is fixed, \\ncapped or collared. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate \\nform. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, \\nexcluding joint ventures and associates, was 5.4% (2009 – 5.2%).\\nForeign currency risk management Our principal objective is to reduce \\nthe effect of exchange rate volatility on short-term profits. Transactional \\ncurrency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income \\nStatement are hedged, typically using forward purchases or sales of \\nforeign currencies and currency options. At the year end, forward foreign \\ncurrency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to \\n£1.083bn were outstanding (2009 – £2.11bn) as detailed in note 22. We \\nhedge the majority of our investments in our international subsidiaries via \\nforeign exchange transactions in matching currencies. Our objective is to \\nmaintain a low cost of borrowing and hedge against material movements \\nin our Group Balance Sheet value. During the year, currency movements \\nincreased the net value of the Group’s overseas assets by £477m (last year \\nincrease of £480m). We translate overseas profits at average foreign \\nexchange rates which we do not currently seek to hedge.\\nCredit risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from \\ndefault by parties to financial transactions across an approved list  \\nof counterparties of good credit quality. The Group’s positions with  \\nthese counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored.\\nCredit risk arising from Tesco Bank’s unsecured lending is managed using  \\nall the normal credit assessment and collections and recoveries systems.  \\nIn terms of liquidity risk Tesco Bank has implemented a conservative \\napproach to the minimum amount of liquid assets its holds and to its  \\nNet Stable Funding Ratio.\\nInsurance We purchased Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability \\nprotection from the open insurance market at ‘catastrophe’ level only.  \\nThe risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the \\nbusiness by using our captive insurance companies, Tesco Insurance \\nLimited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the \\nRepublic of Ireland. Tesco Insurance Limited covers Assets and Earnings, \\nwhile Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability.\\nStatement of compliance\\nThis Business Review has been prepared in accordance with the requirements \\nfor a business review under the Companies Act 2006. The Business Review’s \\nintent is to provide information to shareholders and should not be relied  \\non by any other party or for any other purpose.\\nCautionary statement regarding forward-looking information\\nWhere this review contains forward-looking statements, these are made  \\nby the Directors in good faith based on the information available to them \\nat the time of their approval of this report. These statements should be \\ntreated with caution due to the inherent risks and uncertainties underlying \\nany such forward-looking information.\\nThe Group cautions investors that a number of important factors, including \\nthose in this document, could cause actual results to differ materially from \\nthose contained in any forward-looking statement.

All businesses within the Group are \\nrequired to monitor their compliance with the Group governance framework \\nand this information is reviewed at Board level.\\nCompliance with the Combined Code\\nThe Combined Code on Corporate Governance sets out guidance in the \\nform of principles and provisions on how companies should be directed \\nand controlled to follow good governance practice. The Financial Services \\nAuthority (FSA) requires companies listed in the UK to disclose, in relation \\nto Section 1 of the Combined Code, how they have applied the principles \\nand whether they have complied with its provisions throughout the \\nfinancial year. Where the provisions have not been complied with \\ncompanies must provide an explanation for this.\\nThe Board considers that Tesco PLC complied in full with the Combined \\nCode principles of Corporate Governance and Code of Best Practice for the \\nwhole of the year ended 27 February 2010, with the exception of provision \\nA.3.2, in respect of which the company was not in compliance for part of \\nthe year. \\nProvision A.3.2 requires that at least half of the Board, excluding the \\nChairman, should comprise Non-executive Directors determined by the \\nBoard to be independent. The Board recognises the importance of a \\nbalanced board with an appropriate level of independence. Due to \\nunexpected changes to the Board in the previous year, with the resignation \\nof Carolyn McCall and Mervyn Davies as Non-executive Directors, the \\nBoard was not in balance at the beginning of the year.\\nAt that stage, Ken Hanna’s impending appointment to the Board had \\nalready been announced, and he joined the Board with effect from  \\n1 April 2009, at which point the Board became balanced and once again \\nfully compliant with provision A.3.2.\\nFurther information on the Combined Code can be found at\\xa0www.frc.org.uk. \\nBoard composition and independence \\nAs at 27 February 2010, the Board of Tesco PLC comprised eight Executive \\nDirectors, eight independent Non-executive Directors and David Reid, \\nNon-executive Chairman. Rodney Chase is Deputy Chairman and Senior \\nIndependent Director. The size of the Board is appropriate given the \\ndiverse markets the business operates in and the breadth of operations \\nand services offered in each market.\\nThe structure of the Board and the integrity of the individual Directors ensure \\nthat no single individual or group dominates the decision making process.\\nBiographies for the Directors can be found on pages 36 and 37 of this report.\\nChanges to the Board since 1 March 2009 are as follows:\\nKen Hanna Non-executive Director Appointed 1 April 2009\\nElection of Directors\\nAll Directors have to submit themselves for re-election at least every three \\nyears if they wish to continue serving and are considered by the Board  \\nto be eligible. The Company’s Articles of Association require all new \\nDirectors to be submitted for election by shareholders in their first year \\nfollowing appointment. \\nThe Chairman\\nClear divisions of accountability and responsibility exist and operate \\neffectively for the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive. The \\nChairman has primary responsibility for leading the Board and setting \\nits agenda, while the Chief Executive has executive responsibilities for the \\noperations and results of the Group and making proposals to the Board  \\nfor the strategic development of the Group.\\nSenior Independent Director\\nThe Board has appointed one Non-executive Director, Rodney Chase,  \\nto act as Senior Independent Director. The Senior Independent Director  \\nis available to shareholders to assist in resolving concerns, should the \\nalternative channels be inappropriate. The Senior Independent Director  \\nis also required to lead the discussion in relation to assessing the \\neffectiveness of the Chairman’s performance.\\nNon-executive Directors\\nThe Non-executive Directors bring a wide range of skills and experience,  \\nas well as independent judgement on strategy, risk and performance to  \\nthe Company.\\nThe independence of each Non-executive Director is assessed at least \\nannually. The Combined Code suggests that a Non-executive Director \\nshould be independent in character and judgement and be free from \\nrelationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear  \\nto affect, the Director’s judgement.\\nThe terms and conditions of appointment of Non-executive Directors are \\navailable for inspection at the Company’s registered office.\\nBoard responsibilities\\nThe Board held 8 meetings in the year. It also held a two day off-site \\nmeeting which considered the Group’s strategy. The Board has set out a \\nclear Schedule of Matters Reserved for Board Decision in order to ensure \\nits overall control of the Group’s affairs. These include the approval of:\\n• the Company’s strategic and operating plans;\\n• annual and interim financial statements;\\n• major acquisitions and disposals;\\n• authority levels for expenditure;\\n• treasury policies;\\n• risk management and internal control systems;\\n• group governance policies; and \\n• succession planning for senior executives. \\nThe Board delegates to management the detailed planning and \\nimplementation of these matters in accordance with appropriate risk \\nparameters. The Board monitors compliance with policy and achievement \\nagainst objectives by holding management accountable for its activities \\nthrough regular updates. In addition, each substantial business within the \\nGroup is required to present to the Board on a regular basis, giving it the \\nopportunity to understand and explore issues as deemed necessary.\\nDuring the year ended 27 February 2010, the Board’s scheduled activities \\nincluded the following:\\n• approving interim and full year results;\\n•  receiving reports from the Remuneration Committee, Audit Committee \\nand Nominations Committee;\\n•  receiving reports from other key committees within the Group, including \\nthe Compliance Committee, Corporate Responsibility Committee and \\nFinance Committee;\\n•  receiving reports on governance issues affecting the group, including \\nstakeholder management;\\n•  receiving regular reports on risk management within the Group, \\nincluding the Key Risk Register;\\n•  discussing and approving Group strategy;\\n•  receiving a report on the effectiveness of the Board;\\n•  receiving reports from key businesses within the Group; and\\n•  receiving regular reports on the financial position of the Group and the \\nvarious businesses within the Group.\\n46 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Corporate governance\\nAll Directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary and \\nmay take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense  \\nin conducting their duties. The Company provides insurance cover and \\nindemnities for its Directors and officers. \\nAttendance at meetings\\nThe Board scheduled 8 meetings in the year ended 27 February 2010,  \\nand ad hoc meetings were also convened to deal with matters between \\nscheduled meetings as appropriate. It is expected that all Directors attend \\nBoard and relevant Committee meetings, unless they are prevented from \\ndoing so by prior commitments, and that all Directors will attend the AGM. \\nWhere Directors are unable to attend meetings due to conflicts in their \\nschedules, they receive the papers scheduled for discussion in the relevant \\nmeetings, giving them the opportunity to relay any comments to the \\nChairman in advance of the meeting. Directors leave the meeting where \\nmatters relating to them, or which may constitute a conflict of interest  \\nto them, are being discussed. The table below shows the attendance  \\nof Directors at scheduled Board meetings and at meetings of the Audit, \\nRemuneration and Nominations Committees during the year. \\nBoard processes\\nThe Board governs through a number of Board Committees – in particular, \\nthe Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees – to which certain \\nresponsibilities and duties are delegated. These Committees are properly \\nauthorised under the constitution of the Company to take decisions and \\nact on behalf of the Board within the parameters laid down by the Board. \\nThe Board is kept fully informed of the work of these Committees and any \\nissues requiring resolution are referred to the full Board as appropriate.  \\nA summary of the operations of these Committees is set out below. The \\neffectiveness of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees is \\nunderpinned by their Non-executive Director membership, which provides \\nindependent insight on governance matters. A copy of each Committee’s \\nTerms of Reference is available on our website www.tesco.com/boardprocess. \\nThe Board is serviced by the Company Secretary, who reports to the \\nChairman in respect of his core duties to the Board. \\n     Full Board  Audit  Remuneration  Nomination\\n     meetings  Committee  Committee  Committee\\nNumber of meetings    Actual Possible Actual Possible Actual Possible Actual Possible\\nNon-Executive Directors          \\nDavid Reid (Chairman)   8 8 – – – – 1 1\\nCharles Allen CBE    8 8 – – 7 7 1 1\\nPatrick Cescau     8 8 4 4 7 7 1 1\\nRodney Chase CBE (Senior Independent Director) 8 8 4 4 7 7 1 1\\nKaren Cook    8 8 – – 6 7 1 1\\nHarald Einsmann    8 8 – – 6 7 1 1\\nKen Hanna (appointed 1.4.09)\\n1\\n    6 8 3 4 6 7 1 1\\nKen Hydon    8 8 4 4 – – 1 1\\nJacqueline Tammenoms Bakker   8 8 – – – – 1 1\\nExecutive Directors\\nSir Terry Leahy    8 8 – – – – 1 1\\nRichard Brasher    8 8 – – – – – –\\nPhilip Clarke    8 8 – – – – – –\\nAndrew Higginson    8 8 – – – – – –\\nTim Mason    8 8 – – – – – –\\nLaurie McIlwee    8 8 – – – – – –\\nLucy Neville-Rolfe CMG   8 8 – – – – – –\\nDavid Potts    8 8 – – – – – –\\n \\n1  Ken Hanna was unable to attend two Board meetings, one Audit Committee meeting and one Remuneration Committee meeting due to prior commitments arranged before he \\ncommenced his role at Tesco.\\nPLC Board\\nExecutive Committee\\nMonitoring Committees*\\n• Corporate Responsibility\\n Committee\\n• Compliance Committee\\n• Finance Committee\\nMain Committees\\n• Audit Committee\\n• Remuneration Committee\\n• Nominations Committee\\nJoint V enture Boards Operational Committees Subsidiary Boards\\n*  Reports are discussed by the PLC Board on a regular basis.\\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 47 Corporate governance continued\\nNominations Committee \\nMembers: \\n• David Reid (Chairman)\\n• Charles Allen\\n• Patrick Cescau\\n• Rodney Chase\\n• Karen Cook\\n• Dr Harald Einsmann\\n• Ken Hanna (from 1 April 2009)\\n• Ken Hydon\\n• Jacqueline Tammenoms Bakker\\n• Sir Terry Leahy\\nThe Nominations Committee leads the process \\nfor Board appointments and the re-election  \\nand succession of Directors, as well as making \\nrecommendations for the membership of the \\nAudit and Remuneration Committees. \\nThe Committee is chaired by David Reid and the Company Secretary  \\nalso attends meetings in his capacity as Secretary of the Committee. \\nWhere matters discussed relate to the Chairman, the Senior Independent \\nDirector chairs the meeting. \\nThe Nominations Committee met formally once in the year to discuss  \\nthe ongoing shape and capability of the Board.

The \\nCommittee has authority for decision-making in all areas except those  \\nset out in the Schedule of Matters Reserved for Board Decision and meets \\nformally on a regular basis. A number of other senior executives also  \\nattend the Committee and their valuable operational experience helps \\nbroaden the debate. Their attendance facilitates the communication  \\nof the Committee’s decisions to the rest of the Group. The Company \\nSecretary attends in his capacity as Secretary of the Committee.\\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for implementing Group strategy \\nand policy and for monitoring the performance and compliance of the \\nbusiness, drawing on the work of relevant committees, and reporting on \\nthese matters in full to the Board.\\nThe Executive Committee has set up further committees – including the \\nFinance, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility Committees (which are \\ndescribed in more detail below) – and operational groups which have \\nresponsibility for implementing the key elements of the Group’s strategic \\nplan and managing its UK and international operations, joint ventures, \\nproperty acquisitions, finance, funding and people matters. These \\ncommittees and groups have as members an appropriate mixture of \\nExecutive Directors and senior management from relevant functions. \\nProcedures to deal with Directors’ conflicts of interest\\nThe Company has procedures in place to deal with the situation where  \\na Director has a conflict of interest. As part of these procedures members \\nof the Board are required to:\\n• consider each conflict situation separately on its particular facts;\\n•  consider the conflict situation in conjunction with the rest of their \\nduties under Companies Act 2006;\\n•  keep records and Board minutes as to authorisation granted by \\nDirectors and the scope of any approvals given; and\\n• regularly review conflict authorisation.\\nTraining and development\\nAll new Directors receive a personalised induction programme, tailored  \\nto their experience, background and particular areas of focus, which is \\ndesigned to develop their knowledge and understanding of the Group’s \\nculture and operations. The programme has evolved taking into account \\nfeedback from new directors, and will usually include an overview of the \\nbusiness model and Board processes, meetings with the Executive team \\nand senior managers, site visits at home and abroad and briefings on  \\nkey issues (including social, ethical and environmental (SEE) issues). \\nDirectors also receive an induction to those Board Committees he or she  \\nwill serve on. \\nThe need for Director training is regularly assessed by the Board and \\nregular training sessions are arranged to provide an opportunity for \\nupskilling of the Directors on a variety of areas relevant to the Group’s \\nbusiness, including SEE issues. In the last year the Board received training \\nfocusing, inter alia, on the regulatory and governance issues associated \\nwith operating a financial services business, following the acquisition of \\nTesco Bank in the previous year.\\nThe Board usually meets overseas once each year to facilitate the Directors’ \\nunderstanding of the Group’s international operations. In February 2010,  \\nthe Board visited China and Korea to view first hand the progress and \\ndirection of the business in these markets. In July 2009, the Company  \\nheld its Annual General Meeting in Scotland and the Board took the \\nopportunity to visit some strategically significant parts of the business  \\nin this region.\\nBoard performance evaluation \\nThe performance of the Board is a fundamental component of the Group’s \\nsuccess. The Board regularly reviews its own performance. During the year \\nended 27 February 2010, the Board assessed its own performance. This \\nassessment was co-ordinated and directed by the Chairman with the \\nsupport of the Company Secretary. The Chairman and the Company \\nSecretary carried out in-depth interviews with each Director. The results of \\nthe evaluation were considered by the Board, and confirmed the strength \\nof the strategic and entrepreneurial leadership of the Company, a sound \\ngovernance framework and practices compliant with the Combined Code.\\nThe Chief Executive reviews the performance of each Executive Director. \\nThe Chairman reviews the performance of the Chief Executive and each \\nNon-executive Director. During the year, the Chairman met several times \\nwith the Non-executive Directors, without the Executive Directors present, \\nto discuss Board issues and how to build the best possible team. The Senior \\nIndependent Director met with the Non-executive Directors, in the absence \\nof the Chairman, to assess the Chairman’s performance.\\nRisk management and internal controls \\nAccountabilities \\nAccepting that risk is an inherent part of doing business, our risk \\nmanagement systems are designed both to encourage entrepreneurial \\nspirit and also provide assurance that risk is fully understood and managed. \\nThe Board has overall responsibility for risk management and internal \\ncontrol within the context of achieving the Group’s objectives. Executive \\nmanagement is responsible for implementing and maintaining the \\nnecessary control systems. The role of Internal Audit is to monitor the \\noverall internal control systems and report on their effectiveness to \\nExecutive management, as well as to the Audit Committee, in order  \\nto facilitate its review of the systems. \\nBackground \\nThe Group has a five-year rolling business plan to support the delivery of \\nits strategy of long-term growth and returns for shareholders. Every business \\nunit and support function derives its objectives from the five-year plan and \\nthese are cascaded to managers and staff by way of personal objectives. \\nKey to delivering effective risk management is ensuring our people have  \\na good understanding of the Group’s strategy and our policies, procedures, \\nvalues and expected performance. We have a structured internal \\ncommunications programme that provides employees with a clear \\ndefinition of the Group’s purpose and goals, accountabilities and the  \\nscope of permitted activities for each business unit, as well as individual \\nline managers and other employees. This ensures that all our people \\nunderstand what is expected of them and that decision-making takes \\nplace at the appropriate level. We recognise that our people may face \\nethical dilemmas in the normal course of business so we provide clear \\nguidance based on the Tesco Values. The Values set out the standards  \\nthat we wish to uphold in how we treat people. These are supported  \\nby the Group Code of Business Conduct which was launched this year, \\nreplacing the Code of Ethics, and offers guidance on relationships  \\nbetween the Group and its employees, suppliers and contractors.\\nWe operate a balanced scorecard approach that is known within the  \\nGroup as our Steering Wheel. This unites the Group’s resources around  \\nour customers, people, operations, community and finance. The Steering \\nWheel operates at all levels throughout the Group. It enables the business \\nto be operated and monitored on a balanced basis with due regard for  \\nall stakeholders. \\nRisk management \\nThe Group maintains a Key Risk Register. The Register contains the key \\nrisks faced by the Group including their impact and likelihood, as well as \\nthe controls and procedures implemented to mitigate these risks. The \\ncontent of the Register is determined through regular discussions with \\nsenior management and reviewed by the Executive Committee and the full \\nBoard. A balanced approach allows the degree of controllability to be taken \\ninto account when we consider the effectiveness of mitigation, recognising \\nthat some necessary activities carry inherent risk which may be outside  \\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 49 Corporate governance continued\\nthe Group’s control. Where our risk management process identifies \\nopportunities to improve the business these are built into our future plans.  \\nOur key risks are summarised on pages 41 to 44 of the Business Review. \\nThe risk management process is cascaded through the Group with \\noperating subsidiary boards maintaining their own risk registers and \\nassessing their own control systems. The same process also applies \\nfunctionally in those parts of the Group requiring greater oversight. For \\nexample, the Audit Committee’s Terms of Reference require it to oversee \\nthe Finance Risk Register. The Board assesses significant Social, Ethical \\nand Environmental (SEE) risks to the Group’s short-term and long-term \\nvalue, and incorporates SEE risks on the Key Risk Register where they are \\nconsidered material or appropriate.\\nWe recognise the value of the ABI Guidelines on Responsible Investment \\nDisclosure and confirm that, as part of its regular risk assessment \\nprocedures, the Board takes account of the significance of SEE matters  \\nto the business of the Group. We recognise that a number of investors  \\nand other stakeholders take a keen interest in how companies manage \\nSEE matters and so we report more detail on our SEE policies and \\napproach to managing material risks arising from SEE matters and the \\nKPIs we use both on our website (www.tesco.com/cr2010) and in our \\nCorporate Responsibility Report 2010. To provide further assurance,  \\nthe Group’s Corporate Responsibility KPIs are audited on a regular  \\nbasis by Internal Audit.\\nInternal controls \\nThe Board is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and \\nfor reviewing the effectiveness of such a system. We have a Group-wide \\nprocess for clearly establishing the risks and responsibilities assigned to \\neach level of management and the controls which are required to be \\noperated and monitored. \\nThe CEOs of subsidiary businesses are required to certify by way of  \\nannual governance returns that appropriate governance and compliance \\nprocesses have been adopted. For certain joint ventures, the Board places \\nreliance upon the internal control systems operating within our partners’ \\ninfrastructures and the obligations upon partners’ boards relating to the \\neffectiveness of their own systems. \\nSuch a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of \\nfailure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable  \\nand not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. \\nThe Board has reviewed the effectiveness of internal controls and is \\nsatisfied that the controls in place remain appropriate.\\nMonitoring \\nThe Board oversees the monitoring system and has set specific \\nresponsibilities for itself and the various committees as set out below. Both \\nInternal Audit and our external auditors play key roles in the monitoring \\nprocess, as do several other committees including the Finance Committee, \\nCompliance Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee.  \\nThe Minutes of the Audit Committee and the various other committees \\n(Finance, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility Committees) are \\ndistributed to the Board and each Committee submits a report for formal \\ndiscussion at least once a year. These processes provide assurance that  \\nthe Group is operating legally, ethically and in accordance with approved \\nfinancial and operational policies. \\nAudit Committee \\nThe Audit Committee reports to the Board each year on its review of the \\neffectiveness of the internal control systems for the financial year and the \\nperiod to the date of approval of the financial statements. Throughout  \\nthe year the Committee receives regular reports from the external auditors \\ncovering topics such as quality of earnings and technical accounting \\ndevelopments. The Committee also receives updates from Internal Audit \\nand has dialogue with senior managers on their control responsibilities. It \\nshould be understood that such systems are designed to provide reasonable, \\nbut not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. \\nInternal Audit \\nThe Internal Audit department is fully independent of business operations \\nand has a Group-wide mandate. It undertakes a programme to address \\ninternal control and risk management processes with particular reference \\nto the Turnbull Guidance. It operates a risk-based methodology, ensuring \\nthat the Group’s key risks receive appropriate regular examination. Its \\nresponsibilities include maintaining the Key Risk Register, reviewing and \\nreporting on the effectiveness of risk management systems and internal \\ncontrol with the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee and ultimately \\nto the Board. Internal Audit facilitates oversight of risk and control systems \\nacross the Group through risk committees in Asia and Europe and audit \\ncommittees in a number of our international businesses and joint ventures. \\nThe Head of Internal Audit also attends all Audit Committee meetings. \\nExternal audit \\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, who have been the Company’s external \\nauditor for a number of years, contributes a further independent \\nperspective on certain aspects of our internal financial control systems \\narising from its work, and reports to both the Board and the Audit \\nCommittee. Our policy in relation to the reappointment of the external \\nauditors is to consider their engagement and independence annually.  \\nThe Committee has satisfied itself that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  \\nis independent and there are adequate controls in place to safeguard its \\nobjectivity. One such measure is the non-audit services policy that sets  \\nout criteria for employing external auditors and identifies areas where it is \\ninappropriate for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to work. Non-audit services \\nwork carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is predominantly the \\nreview of subsidiary undertakings’ statutory accounts, transaction work \\nand corporate tax services, where their services are considered to be the \\nmost appropriate. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also follows its own  \\nethical guidelines and continually reviews its audit team to ensure its \\nindependence is not compromised.  \\nFinance Committee \\nMembership of the Finance Committee includes Non-executive Directors \\nwith relevant financial expertise, Executive Directors and members of \\nsenior management. The Committee is chaired by Sir Terry Leahy, CEO. \\nThe Committee usually meets twice a year and its role is to review and \\nagree the Finance Plan on an annual basis, review reports of the Treasury \\nand Tax functions and to review and approve Treasury limits and \\ndelegations. \\nCompliance Committee \\nMembership of the Compliance Committee includes three Executive \\nDirectors and members of senior management. The Committee is chaired \\nby Lucy Neville-Rolfe, Corporate and Legal Affairs Director. The Committee \\nnormally meets six times a year and its remit is to ensure that the Group \\ncomplies with all necessary laws and regulations and other compliance \\npolicies in all of its operations world-wide. The Committee has established \\na schedule for the regular review of operational activities and legal \\nexposure. Each business in the Group has a Compliance Committee \\ndesigned to ensure compliance with both local and Group policies, and \\neach Compliance Committee reports to the Group Compliance Committee \\nat least once a year. \\nCorporate Responsibility Committee \\nThe Corporate Responsibility Committee is chaired by the Corporate  \\nand Legal Affairs Director, Lucy Neville-Rolfe and membership is made  \\nup of senior executives from across the Group. It meets at least four times \\na year to support, develop and monitor policies on SEE issues and to \\nreview threats and opportunities for the Group. Progress in developing \\nCommunity initiatives is monitored by the use of relevant KPIs for the \\nbusinesses within the Group. The Board formally discusses the work of  \\nthe Committee on a regular basis, including progress in implementing  \\nour Community Plan. \\nThe Corporate and Legal Affairs department and the Trading Law and \\nTechnical department provide assurance and advice on legal compliance, \\nhealth and safety, and SEE matters. These functions report on their work \\non a regular basis and escalate matters as appropriate. \\n50 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Corporate governance\\nWhistleblowing\\nThe Group operates a whistleblowing policy and has a confidential \\n‘Protector Line’ service accessible to concerned employees where they  \\ncan report, anonymously if necessary, on issues of malpractice within  \\nthe business. Such issues include illegal and unethical behaviour such as \\nfraud, dishonesty and any practices that endanger our staff, customers  \\nor the environment. \\nComplaints made are treated as confidential and are investigated. Where \\nappropriate, matters will be escalated to the Director of Group Security  \\nfor further action.\\nManagement \\nIn our fast moving business, trading is tracked on a daily and weekly basis, \\nfinancial performance is reviewed weekly and monthly and the Steering \\nWheel is reviewed quarterly. Steering Wheels are operated in business \\nunits across the Group and reports are prepared of performance against \\ntarget KPIs covering the five segments of the Steering Wheel (Customer, \\nOperations, Community, People and Finance) on a quarterly basis, \\nenabling management to measure performance. All major initiatives \\nrequire business cases normally covering a minimum period of five years. \\nPost-investment appraisals, carried out by management, determine the \\nreasons for any significant variance from expected performance. \\nRelations with stakeholders\\nWe are committed to having a constructive dialogue with stakeholders to \\nensure we understand what is important to them and allow ourselves the \\nopportunity to present our position. Engagement helps us identify new \\nrisks and opportunities to ensure that our long-term strategy is sustainable. \\nIn some instances we find that working with stakeholders in partnership \\ncan help deliver shared goals. We might not be able to satisfy all stakeholder \\nconcerns all the time but through engagement we can do our best to \\nbalance competing demands. We know that customers need to be able  \\nto trust our business and they will only trust us if they believe that we are \\nengaging on an appropriate basis with our stakeholders. \\nOur programme of engaging with stakeholders including customers,  \\nstaff, suppliers, investors, government, regulators, non-governmental \\norganisations and others, is set out in more detail in our Corporate \\nResponsibility Report 2010 and on our website (www.tesco.com/cr2010). \\nShareholder engagement\\nWe are committed to maintaining a good dialogue with shareholders \\nthrough proactively organising meetings and presentations as well as \\nresponding to a wide range of enquiries. We seek shareholder views on  \\na range of issues from strategy to corporate governance and SEE issues. \\nWe recognise the importance of communicating appropriately any \\nsignificant Company developments.\\nDuring the year, the Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director  \\nmet with most of our leading shareholders to discuss issues relating to  \\nthe Board, strategy and governance matters, as well as new developments \\nwithin the business. The Chairman’s meetings with major shareholders \\ntook place independently from the Executive team. In addition to this,  \\nour Investor Relations team engage with shareholders on a regular basis, \\nand on a wide range of issues. The Corporate Secretariat team also \\norganise regular meetings, on both a one-to-one and group basis, with \\nsocially responsible investors (SRIs) to discuss the work the Group is  \\ndoing on corporate responsibility and governance-related issues. These \\nmeetings are attended as appropriate by Directors and other members  \\nof senior management.\\nAn Investor Relations report is produced for the Board periodically.

In doing  \\nso, Tesco has continued to build on the track record it has established  \\nover several years.\\nSales, Profit and ROCE Performance over 5 years\\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\\n62.5\\n43.1\\n46.6\\n51.8\\n59.4\\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\\n12.1\\n12.7\\n12.6\\n12.9 12.8\\n*\\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\\n3.2\\n2.2\\n2.7\\n2.8\\n2.9\\nSales (£bn)\\nROCE (%)\\nProfit before tax (£bn)\\n* Restated for the impact of IFRIC 13 and IFRS 2.\\nTesco is already a large and profitable company. A 10% increase in \\nCompany value equates to some £3bn in additional shareholder value, \\nequivalent to the value of a top 50 FTSE organisation. Over the last  \\n5\\xa0years, Tesco has delivered more than £10bn of additional shareholder  \\nvalue through dividends and share price growth. Continuing to grow \\nprofitability from such a high base is demanding but forms the core  \\nof Tesco’s strategy and its supporting processes including executive \\nremuneration. Our remuneration strategy is intended to foster a culture  \\nof outstanding performance, taking into account both the short-term  \\nand long-term needs of the business.\\nIn determining the level of executive reward, the Remuneration Committee \\ncontinues to be conscious of the economic background and widespread \\nconcern about executive remuneration being appropriately justified by \\ncompany performance. It has therefore sought to ensure reward outcomes \\nare proportionate to Tesco’s performance outcome.\\nThe strong result against targets in 2009/10 included improvement on \\nmost of the underlying performance measures relating to productivity  \\nand growth. Against this performance background, the main aspects  \\nof executive remuneration policy and practice for the year are as follows:\\n•  Operational Executive Director salaries were increased from 1 July 2009 \\nby an average of 2.58% after the normal review (against an average \\nacross the Group of 2.5%);\\n•  annual bonus payouts ranged from 75% to 95% of maximum reflecting \\nstrong performance during the year against financial and strategic \\nmilestones. The maximum potential bonus was 250% of salary for the \\nGroup CEO, 300% of salary for the US CEO and 200% of salary for \\nother Executive Directors;\\n•  long-term incentive payout was 124 of a potential maximum of 150% \\nof salary;\\n•  share options vested in full reflecting sustained strong earnings delivery;\\n•  no material changes were made to policy, remuneration mix or scale \\nof incentives;\\n•  deferred awards, already earned from prior years, representing \\n4.5\\xa0million shares became available to Directors; \\n•  there have been no substantial changes to the commercial structure \\nof the terms of existing awards, however, a number of shares have  \\nbeen released from awards already earned from prior years to satisfy  \\ntax liabilities crystallised in the year;\\n•  minor changes to remuneration arrangements relating to leaving \\nconditions were approved by shareholders; and\\n•  there continued to be a high level of share ownership by \\nExecutive Directors.\\nExecutive Director remuneration strategy\\nTesco has a long-standing policy of valuing talent and experience. We seek \\nto provide incentives for delivering high, sustainable and profitable growth \\nwhich leads to a strong increase in additional value for shareholders. We \\noperate in a keenly competitive and rapidly changing retail environment. \\nBusiness success depends on the skills of each member of the key team, \\nbut outstanding business performance comes from teamwork. Tesco has a \\nstable and successful management team, and incentivising and rewarding \\nthat team at senior levels to deliver ever higher levels of performance is \\nvital to our ongoing success and our ability to create shareholder value.  \\nWe believe our incentives should support the continued progress and  \\nthe strengthening of our returns from across the Group, as well as the \\ncreation and development of significant new businesses. \\nBase salary\\nCash bonus Deferred \\nshare bonus\\nPerformance\\nShare Plan \\nGroup & \\nInternational\\nShare \\noptions\\nUS L TIP Group New\\nBusiness\\nIncentive Plan\\nc.12%-33% depending on\\nindividual incentive arrangements\\nand performance c.67%-88% depending on individual incentive arrangements and performance\\nPerformance-related elements Fixed element\\nBalance of fixed and performance related remuneration\\nShort-term performance Long-term performance\\n52 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Remumeration report\\nThe Remuneration Committee believes that the majority of total \\nremuneration should be performance-related and delivered largely  \\nin shares closely to align the interests of shareholders and Executive \\nDirectors. In determining the balance between the fixed and variable \\nelements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages, the \\nCommittee takes into account both policy and market practice.\\nTotal remuneration levels for Executive Directors are reviewed annually by \\nthe Committee taking into account their value to the Company in terms of \\ncontinuing strong performance, potential and competitive market practice. \\nConsideration is also given to reward levels at the next tier of management \\nand across the Group in order to sustain a common sense of purpose and \\nsharing of success as well as to ensure that executive arrangements remain \\nappropriate in the context of wider Group remuneration. When setting the \\nremuneration of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the Group’s \\nperformance against a mixture of corporate objectives and financial \\nmeasures. These corporate objectives include specific measures based  \\non environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, an integral part  \\nof the corporate strategy. Inclusion of these specific measures in a number \\nof parts of the remuneration structure helps to reinforce positive and \\nresponsible behaviour by senior management. To\\xa0find out more go to \\nwww.tesco.com/annualreport2010\\nPerformance related remuneration\\nThe remuneration structures for Executive Directors and other key \\nexecutives are tailored to emphasise the delivery of strong year-on-year \\nearnings growth as well as sustained performance in the longer term.  \\nMore than two-thirds of total remuneration (excluding pension) is linked  \\nto the performance of the business. Long-term performance is rewarded \\nthrough delivery of shares and short-term performance through a \\ncombination of cash and compulsorily deferred shares. This combines \\nemphasis on strong year-on-year performance with long-term executive \\nshare ownership, providing a strong link between the incentives received \\nand shareholder value.\\nPerformance measures\\nThe Executive Directors have a range of performance targets across the \\nvarious incentive plans which reflect the objectives of the Group and their \\nown responsibilities and are aligned with long-term shareholder value \\ncreation. Targets are generally set to reward performance improvement \\ncompared to prior periods, with maximum awards only paying out for \\ndelivery of strong performance.\\nThe measures are summarised in the table below and are based on:\\n•  delivery of improved bottom-line financial results, measured through \\nearnings, both in the present year and sustainably over time;\\n•  enhancement of efficient profitability, measured through return on \\ncapital, whilst growing the business;\\n•  improving share price via the use of share options throughout the \\norganisation;\\n•  achievement of durable improvements in the underlying drivers \\nof performance such as cost reduction, energy efficiency, reduced \\nenvironmental impact and sales growth captured through various \\ncorporate measures; and\\n•  laying foundations for future performance through measures such \\nas accessing new sales footage, developing people and implementing \\ncommunity programmes which are also captured through the  \\ncorporate measures.\\nThe sustainability of our business is key and the Remuneration Committee \\nis satisfied that the measures and targets do not incentivise Executive \\nDirectors to take an inappropriate level of risk.\\nShort-term Performance Measures\\nMeasures Participation Incentivises Maximum potential \\n% of salary\\nPerformance period Delivered via\\nEarnings per share All Executive \\nDirectors\\nYear on year  \\nearnings growth\\n125% (US CEO 62.5%) One year Annual cash and \\nannual deferred  \\nshare bonuses  \\n(3-year deferral)\\nCorporate objectives All Executive \\nDirectors\\nDelivery of strategic \\nbusiness priorities, \\nentrepreneurial  \\nspirit and building \\nframework for  \\nfuture growth\\n55% (US CEO 27.5%) One year Annual cash and \\nannual deferred  \\nshare bonuses  \\n(3-year deferral)\\nTotal shareholder \\nreturn\\nAll Executive \\nDirectors\\nShare price and \\ndividend growth \\nversus competitors\\n20% (US CEO 10%) One year Annual deferred  \\nshare bonuses  \\n(3-year deferral)\\nSpecific US \\nobjectives\\nUS CEO Delivery against \\nfinancial and \\nstrategic milestones \\nfor US business\\n200% One year Annual cash and \\nannual deferred  \\nshare bonuses  \\n(3-year deferral)\\nSpecific US \\nobjectives\\nGroup CEO Delivery against \\nfinancial and \\nstrategic milestones \\nfor US business\\n50% One year Annual deferred  \\nshare bonuses  \\n(3-year deferral)\\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 53 Directors’ remuneration report continued\\nParticipation in the various elements is governed by the Remuneration \\nCommittee and individual Executive Directors are awarded incentives \\nunder the elements which are most relevant to their sphere of responsibility.\\nIf performance is lower than the maximum targets, incentive payments will \\nreduce accordingly and will be zero if threshold levels of performance are \\nnot attained. The Committee has reviewed the performance conditions for \\neach of the incentive arrangements against the Group’s business strategy, \\nits growing global leadership, its position as one of the companies at the \\ntop of the FTSE 100 and the intensely competitive sector in which it operates, \\nand has concluded that they provide a set of comprehensive and robust \\nmeasures of management’s effort and success in creating shareholder value.\\nShare ownership guidelines\\nThe Remuneration Committee believes that Executive Directors holding \\nshares aligns their interests with shareholders and reinforces their \\ncommitment to the business. Executive Directors are required to build  \\nand maintain a shareholding with a value at least equal to their basic  \\nsalary. Shares held in plans which are not subject to forfeiture are included  \\nin this measurement. New appointees will typically be allowed three  \\nyears to establish this shareholding. Full participation in the long-term \\nPerformance Share Plan is conditional upon maintaining the minimum \\nshareholding. All Executive Directors satisfy this requirement, apart from \\nLaurie McIlwee, who was appointed to the Board on 27 January 2009.\\nShares held by Executive Directors \\nas at 27 February 2010\\n0 1 million 2 million 3 million 4 million 5 million 6 million 7 million 8 million\\nOrdinary shares PSP EIP\\nRichard Brasher\\nPhilip Clarke\\nAndrew Higginson\\nTim Mason\\nLaurie Mcllwee\\nLucy Neville-Rolfe\\nDavid Potts\\nSir T erry Leahy\\nIncludes ordinary shares and awards of shares and nil cost options made to Directors which \\nremain subject only to a holding period. Excludes unexercised vested executive share options.\\nFunding of equity awards\\nExecutive incentive arrangements are funded by a mix of newly issued \\nshares and shares purchased in the market. Where shares are newly issued \\nthe Company complies with ABI dilution guidelines on their issue. Currently \\nshares to be issued in respect of executive plans are equivalent to c.4% of \\nshares in issue.\\nFixed remuneration\\nBasic pay\\nBasic pay is designed to attract and retain talented individuals. It needs  \\nto reflect individual capability and any changes in responsibilities as the \\nGroup faces new opportunities and challenges. As the Group continues  \\nto diversify into new product areas and services, as well as expanding \\ninternationally, it seeks to reflect this in the benchmarking that is used.  \\nWe examine salary levels at the major retailers, the leading FTSE \\ncompanies and ensure consideration is given to key international \\ncompetitors. We also take into account pay conditions throughout the \\nGroup as well as the prevailing economic climate in deciding executive \\nannual salary increases. The average increase for senior management \\nbelow Board level last year was 2.58%, in line with the average increase  \\nfor other staff which was typically around 2.5%. Pay levels Group-wide  \\nare determined with consideration to a number of factors, including the \\nprevailing economic environment, discussions with employee \\nrepresentation groups and market practice.\\nBasic salaries are typically increased with effect from 1 July each year  \\nand the Remuneration Committee will again be taking into account the \\nprevailing economic climate in setting Executive Director salaries for the \\ncoming year.\\n   Basic salary 1 July 2009 \\nDirector   £000\\nRichard Brasher     812\\nPhilip Clarke     812\\nAndrew Higginson     812\\nSir Terry Leahy     1,410\\nTim Mason     812\\nLaurie McIlwee*     609\\nLucy Neville-Rolfe*     609\\nDavid Potts     812\\n*  Laurie McIlwee and Lucy Neville-Rolfe’s basic salaries were increased by 10.7% and 9.9% \\nrespectively reflecting their increased experience since their appointment.\\nLong-term Performance Measures\\nMeasures Participation Incentivises Maximum potential \\n% of salary (unless \\notherwise stated)\\nPerformance period Delivered via\\nEPS relative to RPI All Executive \\nDirectors\\nLonger-term \\nearnings growth\\n200%* Three years Executive share \\noptions\\nGroup ROCE All Executive \\nDirectors\\nLong-term business \\nsuccess and \\nshareholder returns\\n100% Three years Performance Share \\nPlan\\nInternational ROCE All Executive \\nDirectors except  \\nUS CEO\\nLong-term business \\nsuccess and \\nshareholder returns\\n50% Three years Performance Share \\nPlan\\nUS EBIT and ROCE US CEO Establishment of \\nsuccessful US \\nbusiness\\n2 million shares** 2010/11 – 2013/14 US Long Term \\nIncentive Plan\\nUS EBIT and ROCE \\nGroup ROCE \\nInternational ROCE\\nGroup CEO Entrepreneurial spirit \\nand establishment of \\nnew businesses within \\nwhole Group \\nperformance\\n2.5 million shares** 2010/11 – 2013/14 Group New Business \\nIncentive Plan\\n*  This is the amount on which the number of shares under option is calculated.

All Executive Directors are members  \\nof the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme which provides a pension of up to  \\ntwo-thirds of base salary on retirement, normally at age 60, dependent  \\non service. The Final Salary Scheme is now closed to new entrants but has \\nbeen replaced throughout the organisation by a different defined-benefit \\npension scheme based on career average earnings. Since April 2006, \\nfollowing implementation of the regulations contained within the Finance \\nAct 2004, Executive Directors have been eligible to receive the maximum \\npension that can be provided from the registered pension scheme. The \\nbalance of any pension entitlement for all Executive Directors is delivered \\nthrough an unapproved retirement benefits scheme (SURBS). Except for \\nTim Mason, the SURBS is ‘secured’ by using a fixed charge over a cash \\ndeposit in a designated account.\\nOver the last few years pension contributions by our Executive Directors \\nhave been increasing progressively. In 2009/10 the level of contribution \\nwas 8% of salary which is in line with senior management’s contribution \\nlevels. Contributions will rise over the next two years to 10% by 2011/12. \\nFurther details of the pension benefits earned by the Directors can be \\nfound on page 58.\\nAll employee share schemes\\nThe Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s all \\nemployee share schemes on the same terms as other UK employees. \\n•   Shares In Success. Shares in the Company are allocated to participants \\nin the scheme up to HMRC approved limits (currently £3,000 per \\nannum). The amount of profit allocated to the scheme is determined  \\nby the Board, taking account of Company performance.\\n•  Buy as You Earn. An HMRC approved share purchase scheme under \\nwhich employees invest up to a limit of £110 on a four-weekly basis  \\nto buy shares at market value in Tesco PLC.\\n•  Save as You Earn. An HMRC approved savings-related share option \\nscheme under which employees save up to a limit of £250 on a four \\nweekly basis via a bank/building society with an option to buy shares  \\nin Tesco PLC at the end of a three-year or five-year period at a discount \\nof up to 20% of the market value. There are no performance conditions \\nattached to SAYE options.\\nOther benefits\\nThe Executive Directors are eligible for car benefits, life assurance, \\ndisability and health insurance and staff discount.\\n2009/10 Performance measurement\\nShort-term performance 2009/10\\nEarnings per share\\nThe reported underlying diluted Group EPS for 2009/10 was 31.66p,  \\nan increase of 9.1% on last year.\\nCorporate objectives\\nThe corporate objectives are based on our balanced scorecard, known  \\nas the Steering Wheel. Corporate objectives for the awards made in \\nrespect of the financial year 2009/10 included increasing sales from  \\nnew space; specific profit targets for international businesses and for \\nretailing services; like-for-like sales growth and the development of the \\nnon-food business; focus on developing trading models internationally; \\nenhancing talent management and capability; embedding the new \\ninternational Community Plans and Community Promises; and reducing \\nour environmental impact. Performance against most targets was within \\nthe target range.\\nTotal shareholder return\\nThe graph below highlights the Group’s total shareholder return \\nperformance over the last five financial years, relative to the FTSE 100 \\nindex of companies. This index has been selected to provide an established \\nand broad-based comparator group of retail and non-retail companies of  \\na similar scale to Tesco.\\nTotal shareholder return (TSR) 1 March 2005 to 27 February 2010\\nFeb 05 Feb 06 Feb 07 Feb 08 Feb 09 Feb 10\\nT esco\\nFTSE 100\\n95\\n120\\n145\\n170\\n195\\nTSR is the notional return from a share or index based on share price \\nmovements and declared dividends.\\nThe Committee considers TSR performance against the FTSE 100 and a \\ncomparator group of international retailers that includes Ahold, Carrefour, \\nJ Sainsbury, Metro, Morrisons, Safeway Inc, Target and Walmart. \\nFollowing the Remuneration Committee’s consideration of the extent to \\nwhich the various performance measures (EPS, corporate objectives and \\nTSR) in respect of the 2009/10 award were achieved, the Executive Directors \\nhave been awarded 95% of the potential maximum for the cash element \\nand 94% of the potential maximum for the deferred shares element of their \\nannual bonus. The Committee believes that this level of bonus appropriately \\nreflects the strong performance against financial and strategic milestones.\\nUS objectives\\nAdditional awards are made to Tim Mason and Sir Terry Leahy subject to \\nperformance conditions which measure the progress of the US business \\nagainst a range of aggressive targets related to the development of  \\nthis business. During 2009/10 advances were made on most measures \\nincluding store development, sales growth, cost management and \\ncustomer factors. However, the ongoing economic downturn did continue \\nto act as a constraint over the year on the pace of growth against the \\ndemanding development objectives.\\nThe Remuneration Committee has assessed the bonus outturn for \\n2009/10 and Tim Mason has been awarded 65% of the potential \\nmaximum for both the cash and deferred shares elements of that part  \\nof his annual bonus which is measured by reference to US-specific targets. \\nSir Terry Leahy has been awarded 65% of the potential maximum  \\nfor that part of his annual bonus which is measured by reference to \\nUS-specific targets and which is satisfied in deferred shares.\\nLong-term performance 2009/10\\nEarnings per share\\nThe three-year performance period for the 2007/8 Executive Option grant \\nover shares with a value of 200% of salary at the date of grant ended at \\nthe financial year end 2009/10. Vesting of these options was conditional  \\non the achievement of earnings per share performance conditions, with \\nthe first 100% subject to the achievement of underlying diluted EPS \\ngrowth of at least RPI plus 9% over three years with the balance vesting \\nfor achieving growth of at least RPI plus 15%. There is no re-testing of \\nperformance. The increase in underlying diluted EPS relative to RPI over \\nthe three years from 2007/8 to 2009/10 exceeded 15% and these options \\nwill therefore vest in full on the third anniversary of their grant.\\nReturn on capital employed\\nFollowing the completion of the three-year performance period for the \\n2007/8 PSP award, the Committee considered the level of performance \\nagainst the target for the first 75% of the PSP award of achieving post-tax \\nGroup ROCE of 14.2% by the end of 2009/10. Post-tax ROCE (calculated  \\non a like-for-like basis with the target originally set) at the end of 2009/10 \\nwas 14.2%, so the full amount of the first 75% of the award will vest.  \\nThe Committee also exercised its judgement as to the extent to which  \\nthe remaining 25% of the PSP award should vest as a result of superior \\nROCE performance, taking into account factors including the level of \\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 55 Directors’ remuneration report continued\\nROCE achieved, the expected ROCE for additional and existing capital \\ninvestment, whether capital spend was in line with strategic objectives  \\nand balanced short-term and long-term investment needs, the level  \\nof sales and underlying profit growth and whether this reflected other \\ndevelopments in the marketplace. Having considered these factors  \\nin detail the Committee concluded that all of the remaining 25% of the \\naward should vest. A total of 100% of the 2007/8 PSP award measured  \\non group performance will therefore vest.\\nFor the 50% of salary award which related to International ROCE \\nperformance, the Committee considered the level of performance against \\nthe target for the first 75% of the International PSP award of achieving \\npost-tax International ROCE of 8.1% by the end of 2009/10. Post-tax \\nInternational ROCE (calculated on a like-for-like basis with the target \\noriginally set) at the end of 2009/10 was 6.9% so 23.1 of the first 75% of \\nthe award will vest. The Committee also exercised its judgement as to the \\nextent to which the remaining 25% of the PSP award should vest as a \\nresult of superior ROCE performance, taking into account the factors \\noutlined above, the Committee concluded that all of the remaining 25%  \\nof the International PSP award should vest. A total of 48.1% of the 2007/8 \\nPSP award measured on international performance will therefore vest.\\nFuture performance measures\\nThe Committee has determined that no change is required for the coming \\nyear in the form of incentive arrangements, nor in the relative balance \\nbetween them. The maximum opportunity under incentive arrangements \\nwill remain the same for the 2010/11 year (as set out on pages 53 and 54). \\nThe same principles as described earlier were also adopted in the \\ndetermination of performance targets. \\nShort-term performance targets\\nWe do not disclose specific future targets for reasons of commercial \\nsensitivity. However it is intended that performance will continue to be \\nmeasured against stretching EPS, TSR and Corporate Objective targets \\naligned with the delivery of our strategy. The continuing difficult market \\nconditions in the US have led to the start-up phase of the US business \\nlasting longer than originally envisaged and so the Group CEO and  \\nUS CEO will continue to have the opportunity to receive an annual bonus \\nrelating to the achievement of financial, strategic and operational targets \\nwhich measure the early-stage development of the US business. Success \\nagainst these measures will contribute to building a strong platform for \\nlong-term sustainable growth of the US business.\\nLong-term performance\\nEarnings per share\\nOptions were granted in 2009/10 to Executive Directors over shares  \\nwith a value of 200% of salary, with an exercise price equal to the market \\nvalue at the date of grant, and any gain is therefore dependent on \\nincreasing the share price between the date of grant and exercise. Vesting \\nof these options is conditional on the achievement of earnings per share \\nperformance conditions, with the first 100% subject to the achievement  \\nof underlying diluted EPS growth of at least RPI plus 9% over three years \\nand the balance vesting for achieving growth of at least RPI plus 15%. \\nPerformance against this target will be measured at the end of 2011/12  \\nto determine the level of vesting.\\nReturn on capital employed – Group and international\\nThe rules of the Performance Share Plan allow awards to be made over \\nshares up to 150% of salary. In the year ended 27 February 2010 awards \\nwere made to all the Executive Directors except Tim Mason over Tesco PLC \\nshares equal to a total of 150% of salary. An award was made to Tim Mason \\nover Tesco PLC shares equal to a total of 100% of salary. For all the \\nExecutive Directors, awards over up to 100% of salary will vest (together \\nwith reinvested dividends) subject to the achievement of Group ROCE \\ntargets. The awards over the equivalent of a further 50% of salary made  \\nto the Executive Directors other than Tim Mason will vest (together with \\nreinvested dividends) subject to the achievement of targets based on \\nInternational ROCE in order to incentivise and reward delivery of higher \\nreturns from invested capital outside the UK (but excluding the US).\\nThe first 75% of the awards will vest on a straight-line basis at the end  \\nof the three-year performance period, with 25% vesting for baseline \\nperformance and the full 75% vesting for maximum performance against \\ntarget. The target in respect of the first 75% of the 2009/10 PSP award is \\nachievement of 13.3% Group ROCE and 7.0% International ROCE at the \\nend of the three-year performance period in 2011/12. The remaining 25% \\nof the awards will vest for superior ROCE performance as judged by the \\nRemuneration Committee taking into account the factors outlined above.\\nIf the Remuneration Committee exercises its judgement to allow some,  \\nor all, of the remaining 25% of the PSP awards to vest, we will describe  \\nin the Directors’ Remuneration Report in the relevant year those factors \\ntaken into account in determining the level of the award which would vest. \\nThere is no re-testing of performance in respect of any targets.\\nReturn on capital employed – US\\nThe Group is seeking to build a substantial presence in the US, which  \\nin time has the potential to become a significant source of value for  \\nour shareholders.\\nThe Tesco PLC US Long Term Incentive Plan 2007 (the US LTIP) has been \\ndesigned to deliver reward only if the US business realises this potential. \\nThe US CEO was made an award of two million shares under the US LTIP \\nin 2007. Awards were also made to other senior members of the US \\nmanagement team. No other Executive Directors will participate in the \\nPlan. Awards under the plan vest based on the ROCE and EBIT performance \\nof the US business as set out on page 63. \\nA key part of the Group’s long-term strategy is to consider new business \\nventures which have the potential for significant long-term value creation \\nfor our shareholders. The Group New Business Incentive Plan (Group Plan) \\nsupports this initiative. Initially only the Group CEO will participate in the \\nGroup Plan. However, awards may be made to other employees at the \\ndiscretion of the Remuneration Committee in the future where this is \\nappropriate to do so in order to support the Group’s new business ventures.\\nAs the Company’s US venture is currently the most developed new \\nbusiness initiative, the award made to the Group CEO under the Group  \\nPlan is focused on the performance of the US venture, although the \\nRemuneration Committee has the flexibility to consider and include other \\nnew business development opportunities within the proposed award. An \\naward of 2.5 million shares was made to the Group CEO in November 2007. \\nThis award will vest based on the ROCE and EBIT performance of the  \\nUS business as set out on page 63, however the plan also requires Group \\nand International ROCE targets to be met and any payouts under this plan \\nwill be scaled back on a pro rata basis to the extent they are not met. In \\naddition, the Remuneration Committee will consider the findings of the \\nGovernance Oversight Committee (described below) and opinions of the \\nAudit Committee as to whether the level of reported results achieved reflects \\nthe underlying financial performance of the Company when considering if, \\nand the extent to which, the award made to the Group CEO will vest.\\nService agreements\\nThe Executive Directors all have rolling service agreements with no fixed \\nexpiry date. These contracts are terminated on notice of 12 months by  \\nthe Company and six months’ notice by the Executive. If an Executive \\nDirector’s employment is terminated (other than pursuant to the notice \\nprovisions in the service agreement or by reason of resignation or \\nunacceptable performance or conduct) the Company will pay a sum \\ncalculated on the basis of basic salary and the average annual bonus paid \\nfor the last two years. No account will be taken of pension. Termination \\npayments will be subject to mitigation. This means that amounts will  \\nbe paid in instalments to permit mitigation. If the termination occurs  \\nwithin one year of retirement, the termination payment will be reduced \\naccordingly. To reflect his length of service with Tesco and the early age  \\nof his appointment as CEO, Sir Terry Leahy’s service agreement provides \\nfor his full pension entitlement to become available on retirement on or \\nafter his 57th birthday. \\nThe Remuneration Committee has agreed that new appointments  \\nof Executive Directors will normally be on a notice period of 12 months.  \\nThe Committee reserves the right to vary this period to 24 months for the \\ninitial period of appointment and for the notice period to then revert to \\n12\\xa0months. The service agreements are available to shareholders to view  \\non request from the Company Secretary. \\n56 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Remumeration report\\nOutside appointments\\nTesco recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become \\nNon-executive Directors of other companies. Such Non-executive duties \\ncan broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit Tesco. \\nSubject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are allowed to  \\naccept Non-executive appointments and retain the fees received, provided \\nthat these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest.\\nExecutive Directors’ biographies which include details of any outside \\nappointments can be found on pages 36 and 37 of this Report.

The Remuneration Committee \\ntakes these into account, along with the view of the Audit Committee,  \\nto ensure that financial performance against targets is indicative of strong \\nand robust business performance. If appropriate, vesting under the  \\nplans may be adjusted by the Remuneration Committee (in respect of \\nExecutive Directors) or the Board (in respect of all other employees who  \\nare participants). In accordance with the Combined Code, any such \\nadjustments to vesting for Executive Directors will be reported to \\nshareholders in the Directors’ Remuneration Report at the relevant time. \\nCompliance\\nIn carrying out its duties, the Remuneration Committee gives full \\nconsideration to best practice.

The awards made under this plan will normally vest in four tranches, four, five, six and seven \\nyears after the date of award for nil consideration. Vesting will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed  \\nin the US business over the seven-year plan. The targets are set out under table 7.\\n2  The maximum number of shares which may be awarded under the US LTIP is two million shares to the US CEO and 1.5 million shares to any other participant. An award of two million \\nshares was made to Tim Mason, US CEO, in November 2007. Awards may be adjusted to take account of any dividends paid or that are payable in respect of the number of shares earned. \\nThe extent to which awards will vest under the US LTIP is conditional on the financial performance of the Company’s US business, based on the achievement of stretching Earnings Before \\nInterest and Tax (EBIT) and Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) targets set by reference to the US long-term business plan.\\n3  A percentage of the EBIT of the US business for the relevant years may be allocated to an EBIT pool (the ‘profit pool’). The profit pool will be capped at 10% in any one year and is \\nexpected to be approximately 5% of cumulative EBIT over the four measurement years (2010/11 to 2013/14). The portion of an award which may vest will be determined by reference to \\nthe value of the EBIT pool as well as performance against the ROCE hurdles for the relevant year, as outlined in the table above. To the extent that the ROCE hurdles for any one year are \\nmet (either in full or in part), but there is insufficient value in the profit pool to fund the vesting of awards, then the actual vesting in that year will be scaled back so that the profit pool is \\nnot exceeded.

The address of the registered office is Tesco House, Delamare \\nRoad, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, EN8 9SL, UK.\\nThe financial year represents the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2010 (prior \\nfinancial year 53 weeks ended 28 February 2009 and includes 53 weeks of \\ntrading for the UK, Republic of Ireland (ROI) and United States of America \\n(US) businesses).\\nAs described in the Report of the Directors, the main activity of the Group \\nis that of retailing, retailing services and financial services.\\nStatement of compliance\\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance \\nwith International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International \\nFinancial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) interpretations as \\nendorsed by the European Union, and those parts of the Companies Act \\napplicable to companies reporting under IFRS.\\nBasis of preparation\\nThe financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, generally \\nrounded to the nearest million. They are prepared on the historical cost \\nbasis, except for certain financial instruments, share-based payments, \\ncustomer loyalty programmes and pensions that have been measured  \\nat fair value.\\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently  \\nto all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.\\nBasis of consolidation\\nThe Group financial statements consist of the financial statements of  \\nthe ultimate Parent Company (Tesco PLC), all entities controlled by the \\nCompany (its subsidiaries) and the Group’s share of its interests in joint \\nventures and associates.\\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of \\nsubsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to bring the accounting policies \\nused into line with those of the Group.\\nSubsidiaries\\nA subsidiary is an entity whose operating and financing policies are \\ncontrolled, directly or indirectly, by Tesco PLC.\\nThe accounts of the Parent Company’s subsidiary undertakings are \\nprepared to dates around the Group year end.\\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated \\nfinancial statements from the date that control commences until the date \\nthat control ceases.\\nIntragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and \\nexpenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing \\nthe consolidated financial statements.\\nJoint ventures and associates\\nA joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long-\\nterm basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more \\nother venturers under a contractual agreement.\\nAn associate is an undertaking, not being a subsidiary or joint venture,  \\nover which the Group has significant influence and can participate in the \\nfinancial and operating policy decisions of the entity.\\nThe Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates is included \\nin the Group Income Statement using the equity method of accounting. \\nInvestments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group Balance \\nSheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net \\nassets of the entity, less any impairment in value. The carrying values of \\ninvestments in joint ventures and associates include acquired goodwill.\\nIf the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or \\nexceeds its investment in the joint venture or associate, the Group does \\nnot recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or \\nmade payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.\\nUnrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures and \\nassociates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.\\nUse of assumptions and estimates\\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires \\nmanagement to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect \\nthe application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, \\nincome and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are \\nbased on historical experience and various other factors that are believed \\nto be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the \\nbasis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities \\nthat are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ \\nfrom these estimates.\\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing \\nbasis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in \\nwhich the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in \\nthe period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both \\ncurrent and future periods.\\nCritical estimates and assumptions are made in particular with regard to \\nestablishing uniform depreciation and amortisation periods for the Group, \\nimpairment testing (including loans), provisions for onerous leases and other \\nprovisions, assumptions for measuring pension provisions and fair value of \\nshare-based payments, determination of the fair value of obligations to \\npurchase minority interests and fair value of derivative financial instruments, \\nclassification of leases as operating leases versus finance leases (including on \\nsale and leasebacks), the likelihood that tax assets can be realised and the \\nclassification of certain operations as held for sale.\\nChanges in accounting policy and disclosure\\nThe Group has adopted the following new and amended standards and \\ninterpretations as of 1 March 2009:\\n•  IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’, effective for annual periods \\nbeginning on or after 1 July 2008, requires customer loyalty awards to \\nbe accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction in \\nwhich they are granted. Part of the fair value of the consideration \\nreceived relating to the customer loyalty awards is deferred and \\nsubsequently recognised over the period in which the awards are \\nredeemed. The results for the 53 weeks ended 28 February 2009 have \\nbeen restated accordingly. The impact on the Group Income Statement \\nfor the year ended 28 February 2009, is a £429m reduction in total \\nrevenue, £396m reduction in cost of sales and a £9m decrease to the \\ntaxation charge for the year. The net impact is a decrease of £33m to \\nprofit before tax and £24m to profit after tax. The net impact to the \\nGroup Balance Sheet as at 28 February 2009 is a £53m reduction in \\nshareholders’ equity, £73m increase in trade and other payables and  \\na £20m reduction in the provision for deferred tax. The net impact to \\nthe Group Balance Sheet as at 24 February 2008 is a £29m reduction in \\nshareholders’ equity, £40m increase in trade and other payables and  \\nan £11m reduction in the provision for deferred tax. The prior year effect \\nof the restatement on basic and diluted earnings per share is a reduction \\nof 0.36p per share, and 0.35p per share, respectively.\\n•  Amendment to IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payment’ – Vesting Conditions \\nand Cancellations, effective for annual periods beginning on or after \\n1\\xa0January 2009 clarifies that only service and performance conditions \\nare vesting conditions. Any other conditions are non-vesting conditions \\nwhich have to be taken into account to determine the fair value of the \\nequity instruments granted. The award must be treated as a cancellation \\nwhere the award does not vest as a result of a failure to meet a non-\\nvesting condition that is within the control of either the Group or the \\ncounterparty. Cancellations are treated as accelerated vestings and all \\nremaining future charges are immediately recognised in the Group \\nIncome Statement with the credit recognised directly in equity. The \\nresults for the year ended 28 February 2009 have been restated \\naccordingly. The impact on the Group Income Statement, Group \\nBalance Sheet, basic and diluted earnings per share for the prior year \\nwas not material.\\nNote 1 Accounting policies\\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 75 Notes to the Group financial statements continued\\n•  IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, effective for annual periods beginning \\non or after 1 January 2009 replaces IAS 14 ‘Segment Reporting’ and \\nrequires operating segments to be reported in a manner consistent with \\nthe internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. \\nThe chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for resource \\nallocation and assessing performance of the operating segments, the \\nkey performance measure being trading profit, has been identified as \\nthe Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. \\n•  IAS 1 (revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, effective for \\nannual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, prohibits the \\npresentation of items of income and expenses (that is, ‘non-owner \\nchanges in equity’) in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity,  \\nand requiring ‘non-owner changes in equity’ to be presented in a \\nperformance statement. The Group has elected to present two \\nstatements: a Group Income Statement and a Group Statement of \\nComprehensive Income. The consolidated financial information has \\nbeen prepared under the revised disclosure requirements. There was  \\nno impact on the results or net assets of the Group. Due to the adoption \\nof IFRIC 13 and the amendments to IFRS 2, a Group Balance Sheet as  \\nat 24 February 2008 has been presented as required by IAS 1 (revised) \\nwhen there is a retrospective restatement. \\n•  Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments – Disclosures’, effective \\nfor annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 requires \\nenhanced disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.\\nSale and repurchase agreement (Tesco Bank)\\n•  In order to align with emerging industry practice the Treasury Bills and \\nrelated Medium Term Notes previously recognised have been restated in \\nGroup Balance Sheet as at 28 February 2009. These balances arose as a \\nresult of a securitisation and associated sale and repurchase agreement \\nentered into as part of the Special Liquidity Scheme during the year \\nended 28 February 2009. The effect of the change in the prior year is a \\nreduction in loans and advances to banks and other financial assets of \\n£588m, with a related reduction in current borrowings.\\nIFRS 3 Business combinations \\nUnder IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, any adjustments to the provisional \\nfair values allocated within 12 months of an acquisition date are calculated \\nas if the fair value at the acquisition date had been recognised from  \\nthat date. As a result, goodwill relating to the following acquisitions has \\nbeen restated:\\n•  Homever (acquired 30 September 2008) – the net impact of the \\nrestatement is an increase in goodwill of £14m, increase in trade  \\nand other receivables of £22m, increase in trade and other payables  \\nof £2m and increase in non-current provisions of £34m.\\n•  Tesco Bank (acquired on 19 December 2008) – the net impact of the \\nrestatement is an increase in goodwill of £35m, increase in deferred  \\ntax assets of £28m, increase in non-current provisions of £99m and  \\na decrease in retained earnings of £36m.\\nRevenue\\nRetailing\\nRevenue consists of sales through retail outlets.\\nRevenue is recorded net of returns, relevant vouchers/offers and value-\\nadded taxes, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have \\nbeen transferred to the buyer. Relevant vouchers/offers include: money-off \\ncoupons, conditional spend vouchers and offers such as buy one get one \\nfree (BOGOF) and 3 for 2.\\nCommission income is recorded based on the terms of the contracts and  \\nis recognised when the service is provided.\\nFinancial Services\\nRevenue consists of interest, fees and commission receivable.\\nInterest income on financial assets that are classified as loans and \\nreceivables is determined using the effective interest rate method. This is \\nthe method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or for a \\ngroup of assets, and of allocating the interest income over the expected \\nlife of the asset. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the \\nestimated future cash flows to the instrument’s initial carrying amount. \\nCalculation of the effective interest rate takes into account fees receivable, \\nthat are an integral part of the instrument’s yield, premiums or discounts \\non acquisition or issue, early redemption fees and transaction costs. \\nFees in respect of services are recognised on an accruals basis as service  \\nis provided. The arrangements are generally contractual and the cost of \\nproviding the service is incurred as the service is rendered. The price is \\nusually fixed and always determinable. Significant fee types include credit \\ncard related services fees such as interchange, late payment and balance \\ntransfer fees. \\nThe Group receives insurance commission from the sale of general \\ninsurance policies, which is dependent on the profitability of the underlying \\ninsurance policies.\\nClubcard and loyalty initiatives\\nThe cost of Clubcard and loyalty initiatives is treated as a deduction from \\nsales and part of the fair value of the consideration received is deferred and \\nsubsequently recognised over the period that the awards are redeemed.\\nThe fair value of the points awarded is determined with reference to the \\nfair value to the customer and considers factors such as redemption via \\nClubcard deals versus money-off-in-store including Double Up and \\nredemption rate.\\nComputers for Schools and Sport for Schools and Club vouchers are issued \\nby Tesco for redemption by participating schools/clubs and are part of our \\noverall Community Plan. The cost of the redemption (i.e. meeting the \\nobligation attached to the vouchers) is treated as a cost rather than a \\ndeduction from sales.  \\nOther income\\nFinance income, excluding income arising from financial services, is \\nrecognised in the period to which it relates using the effective interest rate \\nmethod. Dividends are recognised when a legal entitlement to receive \\npayment arises.\\nOperating profit\\nOperating profit is stated after profit arising on property-related items but \\nbefore the share of results of joint ventures and associates, finance income \\nand finance costs.\\nProperty, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and any recognised impairment in value. \\nProperty, plant and equipment assets are depreciated on a straight-line \\nbasis to their residual value over their anticipated useful economic lives.\\nThe following depreciation rates are applied for the Group:\\n •  freehold and leasehold buildings with greater than 40 years unexpired – \\nat 2.5% of cost;\\n •  leasehold properties with less than 40 years unexpired are depreciated \\nby equal annual instalments over the unexpired period of the lease; and\\n •  plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings and motor vehicles – at rates \\nvarying from 9% to 50%.\\nAssets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful \\nlives on the same basis as owned assets or, when shorter, over the term of \\nthe relevant lease.\\nAll property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in \\naccordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ when there are indications \\nthat the carrying value may not be recoverable.\\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued\\n76 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements\\nBorrowing costs\\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction  \\nof qualifying assets are capitalised. Qualifying assets are those that \\nnecessarily take a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended \\nuse. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Group Income \\nStatement in finance costs, excluding those arising from financial services, \\nin the period in which they occur. For Tesco Bank finance cost on financial \\nliabilities is determined using the effective interest rate method and is \\nrecognised in cost of sales. \\nInvestment property\\nInvestment property is property held to earn rental income and/or for \\ncapital appreciation rather than for the purpose of Group operating \\nactivities. Investment property assets are carried at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and any recognised impairment in value. The depreciation \\npolicies for investment property are consistent with those described for \\nowner-occupied property.\\nLeasing\\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease \\ntransfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. \\nAll other leases are classified as operating leases. \\nThe Group as a lessor\\nAmounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as \\nreceivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the leases. \\nFinance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a \\nconstant periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment in the lease.\\nRental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis \\nover the term of the relevant lease.\\nThe Group as a lessee\\nAssets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at \\ntheir fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease \\npayments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding \\nliability is included in the Group Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. \\nLease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction \\nof the lease obligations so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the \\nremaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the \\nGroup Income Statement.\\nRentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Group Income \\nStatement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.\\nSale and leaseback\\nA sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an asset and \\nimmediately reacquires the use of that asset by entering into a lease with \\nthe buyer. The accounting treatment of the sale and leaseback depends \\nupon the substance of the transaction (by applying the lease classification \\nprinciples described above) and whether or not the sale was made at the \\nasset’s fair value.\\nFor sale and finance leasebacks, any apparent profit or loss from the  \\nsale is deferred and amortised over the lease term. For sale and operating \\nleasebacks, generally the assets are sold at fair value, and accordingly  \\nthe profit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately in the Group \\nIncome Statement.\\nFollowing initial recognition, the lease treatment is consistent with those \\nprinciples described above.\\nBusiness combinations and goodwill\\nAll business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase \\nmethod.\\nOn acquisition, the assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and \\ncontingent liabilities of an acquired entity are measured at their fair value. \\nThe interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion \\nof the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.\\nThe Group recognises intangible assets as part of business combinations at \\nfair value on the date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values \\nis based upon management’s judgement and includes assumptions on the \\ntiming and amount of future incremental cash flows generated by the \\nassets acquired and the selection of an appropriate cost of capital. The \\nuseful lives of intangible assets are estimated, and amortisation charged \\non a straight-line basis.\\nGoodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of an \\nacquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets/net \\nliabilities of the acquired subsidiary, joint venture or associate at the  \\ndate of acquisition. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value  \\nof the Group’s share of the net assets/net liabilities of the acquired entity \\n(i.e. a discount on acquisition) then the difference is credited to the Group \\nIncome Statement in the period of acquisition. \\nAt the acquisition date of a subsidiary, goodwill acquired is recognised as \\nan asset and is allocated to each of the cash-generating units expected to \\nbenefit from the business combination’s synergies and to the lowest level \\nat which management monitors the goodwill. Goodwill arising on the \\nacquisition of joint ventures and associates is included within the carrying \\nvalue of the investment.\\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually by assessing the \\nrecoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill \\nrelates. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, \\nand value in use. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating \\nunit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.\\nAny impairment is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement \\nand is not subsequently reversed.\\nOn disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable \\namount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss  \\non disposal. \\nGoodwill arising on acquisitions before 29 February 2004 (the date of \\ntransition to IFRS) was retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject \\nto being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to \\nreserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been restated and will not \\nbe included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.\\nIntangible assets\\nAcquired intangible assets\\nAcquired intangible assets, such as software, pharmacy licences, customer \\nrelationships, contracts and brands, are measured initially at cost and are \\namortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, at \\n2%-100% of cost per annum.\\nInternally-generated intangible assets – Research and development \\nexpenditure\\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. \\nDevelopment expenditure incurred on an individual project is carried \\nforward only if all the criteria set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ are  \\nmet, namely:\\n •  an asset is created that can be identified (such as software or new \\nprocesses);\\n •  it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic \\nbenefits; and\\n •  the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\\nFollowing the initial recognition of development expenditure, the cost  \\nis amortised over the project’s estimated useful life, usually at 14%-25%  \\nof cost per annum.\\nImpairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill\\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its \\ntangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication \\nthat those assets are impaired. If such indication exists, the recoverable \\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued\\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 77 Notes to the Group financial statements continued\\namount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of  \\nthe impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash  \\nflows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates  \\nthe recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the  \\nasset belongs. \\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and \\nvalue in use. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating \\nunit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount \\nof the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. \\nAn impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.\\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of \\nthe asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of \\nthe recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does \\nnot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no \\nimpairment loss had been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating \\nunit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as a \\ncredit to the Group Income Statement immediately.\\nOther investments\\nOther investments in the Group Balance Sheet comprise loan receivable \\nand available-for-sale financial assets. Refer to the financial instruments \\naccounting policy for further detail.\\nLoan receivables are recognised at amortised cost and available-for-sale \\nfinancial assets are recognised at fair value.\\nInventories\\nInventories comprise goods held for resale and properties held for, or in the \\ncourse of, development and are valued at the lower of cost and fair value \\nless costs to sell using the weighted average cost basis.\\nShort-term investments\\nShort-term investments in the Group Balance Sheet consist of deposits \\nwith money market funds. \\nCash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents in the Group Balance Sheet consist of cash at \\nbank, in hand and demand deposits with banks together with short-term \\ndeposits with an original maturity of three months or less.\\nNon-current assets held for sale\\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if \\ntheir carrying amount will be recovered through sale rather than \\ncontinuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is \\nhighly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate \\nsale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale \\nand it should be expected to be completed within one year from the date \\nof classification.\\nNon-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are \\nmeasured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\\nPensions and similar obligations\\nThe Group accounts for pensions and other post-employment benefits \\n(principally private healthcare) under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.\\nIn respect of defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted \\npresent value (using the projected unit credit method) whilst plan assets \\nare recorded at fair value. The operating and financing costs of such plans \\nare recognised separately in the Group Income Statement; service costs \\nare spread systematically over the expected service lives of employees and \\nfinancing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise. Actuarial \\ngains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group Statement of \\nComprehensive Income.\\nPayments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense \\nas they fall due.\\nShare-based payments\\nEmployees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form  \\nof share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services \\nin exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions) or \\nin exchange for entitlements to cash payments based on the value of the \\nshares (cash-settled transactions).\\nThe fair value of employee share option plans is calculated at the grant \\ndate using the Black-Scholes model. In accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-\\nBased Payment’, the resulting cost is charged to the Group Income \\nStatement over the vesting period. The value of the charge is adjusted  \\nto reflect expected and actual levels of vesting.\\nTaxation\\nThe tax expense included in the Group Income Statement consists of \\ncurrent and deferred tax. \\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, \\nusing tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet  \\ndate. Tax is recognised in the Group Income Statement except to the \\nextent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income  \\nor directly in equity, in which case it is recognised other comprehensive \\nincome or equity, respectively. \\nDeferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method,  \\nproviding for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of \\nassets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts  \\nused for taxation purposes. \\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or \\nsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged  \\nor credited in the Group Income Statement, except when it relates to items \\ncharged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income, in \\nwhich case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity, or other \\ncomprehensive income, respectively.\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that \\ntaxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary \\ndifferences can be utilised.\\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance \\nsheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that \\nsufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to \\nbe recovered.\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there \\nis a legally enforceable right to set-off current taxation assets against \\ncurrent taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.\\nForeign currencies\\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on \\nthe date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets \\nand liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at \\nthe rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to \\nthe Group Income Statement for the period.\\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Pounds \\nSterling according to the functional currency concept of IAS 21 ‘The Effects \\nof Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’. Since the majority of consolidated \\ncompanies operate as independent entities within their local economic \\nenvironment, their respective local currency is the functional currency. \\nTherefore, assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries denominated in \\nforeign currencies are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date  \\nof the Group Balance Sheet; profits and losses are translated into Pounds \\nSterling at average exchange rates for the relevant accounting periods. \\nExchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred \\nto the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are \\nrecognised as income or expenses in the period in which the operation  \\nis disposed of.\\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued\\n78 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements\\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign \\nentity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and \\ntranslated at the closing rate.\\nFinancial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s \\nBalance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual \\nprovisions of the instrument.\\nTrade receivables\\nTrade receivables are non interest-bearing and are recognised initially at \\nfair value, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nrate method, reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated \\nirrecoverable amounts.\\nInvestments\\nInvestments are recognised at trade date. Investments are classified as \\neither held for trading or available-for-sale, and are recognised at fair value.\\nThere are no investments classified as held for trading.\\nFor available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes  \\nin fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed \\nof or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or \\nloss previously recognised in equity is included in the net result for the \\nperiod. Interest calculated using the effective interest rate method is \\nrecognised in the Group Income Statement. Dividends on an available-for-\\nsale equity instrument are recognised in the Group Income Statement \\nwhen the entity’s right to receive payment is established.\\nLoans and advances\\nLoans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or \\ndeterminable payments that are not quoted in an active market and \\ninclude amounts due from customers and amounts due from other banks. \\nThe Group has no intention of trading these loans and advances and \\nconsequently they are not classified as held for trading or designated  \\nas fair value through profit and loss. Loans and advances are initially \\nrecognised at fair value plus directly related transaction costs. Subsequent \\nto initial recognition, these assets are carried at amortised cost using the \\neffective interest method less any impairment losses. Income from these \\nfinancial assets is calculated on an effective yield basis and is recognised  \\nin the Group Income Statement.\\nImpairment of loans and advances\\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of  \\nits loans and advances to determine whether there is any indication that \\nthose assets have suffered an impairment loss. An impairment loss has \\nbeen incurred if there is objective evidence that an event or events since \\ninitial recognition of the asset have adversely affected the amount or \\ntiming of future cash flows from the asset.\\nIf there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a financial asset  \\nor group of financial assets classified as loans and advances has been \\nincurred, the Group measures the amount of the loss as the difference \\nbetween the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets and the \\npresent value of estimated future cash flows from the asset or group of \\nassets discounted at the effective interest rate of the instrument at initial \\nrecognition. Impairment losses are assessed individually for financial assets \\nthat are individually significant and collectively for assets that are not \\nindividually significant. In making collective assessments of impairment, \\nfinancial assets are grouped into portfolios on the basis of similar risk \\ncharacteristics. Future cash flows from these portfolios are estimated on \\nthe basis of the contractual cash flows and historical loss experience for \\nassets with similar credit risk characteristics. Historical loss experience is \\nadjusted, on the basis of current observable data, to reflect the effects of \\ncurrent conditions not affecting the period of historical experience.\\nImpairment losses are recognised in the Group Income Statement and the \\ncarrying amount of the financial asset or group of financial assets reduced \\nby establishing an allowance for impairment losses. If in a subsequent \\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued\\nperiod the amount of the impairment loss reduces and the reduction \\ncan be ascribed to an event after the impairment was recognised, the \\npreviously recognised loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance. Once \\nan impairment loss has been recognised on a financial asset or group of \\nfinancial assets, interest income is recognised on the carrying amount \\nusing the rate of interest at which estimated future cash flows were \\ndiscounted in measuring impairment.\\nLoan impairment provisions are established on a portfolio basis taking \\ninto account the level of arrears, security, past loss experience, credit \\nscores and defaults based on portfolio trends. The most significant \\nfactors in establishing the provisions are the expected loss rates and the \\nrelated average life. The portfolios include credit card receivables and \\nother personal advances. The future credit quality of these portfolios is \\nsubject to uncertainties that could cause actual credit losses to differ \\nmaterially from reported loan impairment provisions. These uncertainties \\ninclude the economic environment, notably interest rates and their \\neffect on customer spending, the unemployment level, payment \\nbehaviour and bankruptcy trends.\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to  \\nthe substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity \\ninstrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of \\nthe Group after deducting all of its liabilities.\\nInterest-bearing borrowings\\nInterest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at  \\nfair value, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial \\nrecognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost \\nwith any difference between cost and redemption value being \\nrecognised in the Group Income Statement over the period of the \\nborrowings on an effective interest basis.\\nTrade payables\\nTrade payables are non interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.\\nEquity instruments\\nEquity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds \\nreceived, net of direct issue costs.\\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure  \\nto foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risks arising from \\noperating, financing and investing activities. The Group does not hold  \\nor issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, however,  \\nif derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for \\nas such.\\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. \\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by \\nreference to market values for similar financial instruments, by \\ndiscounted cash flows, or by the use of option valuation models. Where \\nderivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses  \\non remeasurement are immediately recognised in the Group Income \\nStatement. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition \\nof any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge \\nrelationship and the item being hedged.\\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to \\ndocument from inception the relationship between the item being \\nhedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to \\ndocument and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between \\nthe hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the \\nhedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness \\ntesting is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge \\nremains highly effective.\\nDerivative financial instruments with maturity dates of more than one \\nyear from the balance sheet date are disclosed as non-current.\\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 79 Notes to the Group financial statements continued\\nFair value hedging\\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when \\nthey hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a \\nrecognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that  \\nare designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group \\nIncome Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the \\nhedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.\\nDerivative financial instruments qualifying for fair value hedge accounting \\nare principally interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.\\nCash flow hedging\\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when \\nthey hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that are either \\nattributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or \\nliability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction.\\nThe effective element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative \\ninstrument is recognised directly in equity.\\nThe associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and \\nrecognised in the Group Income Statement in the same period or periods \\nduring which the hedged transaction affects the Group Income Statement. \\nThe classification of the effective portion when recognised in the Group \\nIncome Statement is the same as the classification of the hedged \\ntransaction. Any element of the remeasurement of the derivative \\ninstrument which does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is \\nrecognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance \\nincome or costs.\\nDerivative instruments qualifying for cash flow hedging are principally \\nforward foreign exchange transactions and interest rate swaps.\\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires  \\nor is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge \\naccounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the \\nhedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the \\nforecasted transaction occurs or the original hedged item affects the \\nGroup Income Statement. If a forecasted hedged transaction is no longer \\nexpected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is \\ntransferred to the Group Income Statement.\\nNet investment hedging\\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges \\nwhen they hedge the Group’s net investment in an overseas operation. \\nThe effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from remeasuring \\nthe derivative instrument is recognised directly in equity. Any ineffective \\nelement is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement. Gains \\nand losses accumulated in equity are included in the Group Income \\nStatement when the foreign operation is disposed of.\\nDerivative instruments qualifying for net investment hedging are \\nprincipally forward foreign exchange transactions.\\nTreatment of agreements to acquire minority interests\\nThe Group has entered into a number of agreements to purchase the \\nremaining shares of subsidiaries with minority shareholdings.\\nUnder IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’, the net present value of \\nthe expected future payments are shown as a financial liability. At the end \\nof each period, the valuation of the liability is reassessed with any changes \\nrecognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs \\nfor the year. Where the liability is in a currency other than Pounds Sterling, \\nthe liability has been designated as a net investment hedge. Any change in \\nthe value of the liability resulting from changes in exchange rates is \\nrecognised directly in equity.\\nProvisions \\nProvisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive \\nobligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that a transfer \\nof economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and where  \\na reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\\nProvisions for onerous leases are recognised when the Group believes  \\nthat the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations exceed the \\neconomic benefits expected to be received under the lease.

Provisions  \\nfor dilapidation costs are recognised on a lease by lease basis.\\nOther recent accounting developments\\nStandards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2010 or issued \\nand early adopted: \\nIn preparing the Group financial statements for the current year, the Group \\nhas adopted the following new and amended standards and \\ninterpretations which have no impact on the results or net assets of the \\nGroup (unless otherwise stated):\\n•  Amendment to IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’, effective for annual periods \\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2009. The standard has been revised to \\nrequire capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to a \\nqualifying asset. \\n•  Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and IAS 1 \\n‘Presentation of Financial Statements’– Puttable Instruments and \\nInstruments with Obligations Arising on Liquidation, effective for annual \\nperiods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.\\n•  Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ – \\nPresentation on Classification of Rights Issues, effective for annual \\nperiods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.\\n•  Amendments to IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of IFRSs’ and IAS 27 \\n‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ – Cost of an \\nInvestment of a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate, \\neffective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after  \\n1 January 2009.\\n•  IFRIC 9 ‘Reassessment of embedded derivatives’ and IAS 39 ‘Financial \\nInstruments: Recognition and Measurement – Embedded Derivatives \\n(amendments)’ effective for annual periods beginning on or after  \\n1 July 2008.\\n•  IFRIC 14 ‘The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding \\nRequirements and their Interaction’, effective for annual periods \\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2008. \\n•  IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’, effective for \\nannual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. \\n•  IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’, effective \\nfor annual periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008. \\nStandards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and \\nunder review as to their impact on the Group:\\n•  Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payment’ – Group Cash-Settled \\nTransactions, effective for annual periods beginning on or after \\n1\\xa0January 2010. In addition to incorporating IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’,  \\nand IFRIC 11 ‘ IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions’, the \\namendments expand on the guidance of IFRIC 11 to address the \\nclassification of group arrangements that were not covered by that \\ninterpretation. The new guidance is not expected to have a material \\nimpact on the Group’s financial statements.\\n•  IAS 27 (revised) ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’, \\neffective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The \\nrevised standard requires the effects of all transactions with non-\\ncontrolling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in \\ncontrol and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains \\nand losses. The standard also specifies the accounting when control of \\nan entity is lost. Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair \\nvalue, and a gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement. The \\nGroup will apply IAS 27 (revised) prospectively to transactions with non-\\ncontrolling interests from 28 February 2010.\\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued\\n80 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements\\n•  IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’, effective for business \\ncombinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning \\nof the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009. \\nThe revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to \\nbusiness combinations, with some significant changes, including: all \\npayments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the \\nacquisition date, with the contingent payments that are classified as \\ndebt subsequently remeasured through the Group Income Statement. \\nThere is a choice on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to measure the \\nnon-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-\\ncontrolling interest’s proportionate share of the acquirer’s net assets.  \\nAll acquisition-related costs should be expensed. The Group will apply \\nIFRS 3 (revised) prospectively to all business combinations from \\n28\\xa0February 2010.\\n•  Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and \\nMeasurement’ – Eligible Hedged Items, effective for annual periods \\nbeginning on or after 1 July 2009. The amendment provides clarification \\non how the principles that determine whether a hedged risk or portion \\nof cash flows is eligible for designation should be applied in particular \\nsituations.\\n•  IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, effective for annual periods beginning on \\nor after 1 January 2013. This is the first part of a new standard on \\nclassification and measurement of financial assets that will replace IAS 39.\\n•  Amendment to IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, effective for annual \\nperiods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.\\n•  IFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners’, effective for \\nannual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. \\n•  IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’, effective for transfers of \\nassets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009.\\n•  IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’, \\neffective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010.\\nThe Group continually reviews amendments to the standards made under \\nthe IASB’s annual improvements project.\\nUse of non-GAAP profit measures – underlying profit before tax\\nThe Directors believe that underlying profit before tax and underlying \\ndiluted earnings per share measures provide additional useful information \\nfor shareholders on underlying trends and performance. These measures \\nare used for internal performance analysis. Underlying profit is not defined \\nby IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other \\ncompanies’ adjusted profit measures. It is not intended to be a substitute \\nfor, or superior to IFRS measurements of profit.\\nThe adjustments made to reported profit before tax are:\\n •  IAS 32 and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments’ – fair value remeasurements – \\nUnder IAS 32 and IAS 39, the Group applies hedge accounting to its \\nvarious hedge relationships when allowed under the rules of IAS 39  \\nand when practical to do so. Sometimes the Group is unable to apply \\nhedge accounting to the arrangements but continues to enter into  \\nthese arrangements as they provide certainty or active management  \\nof the exchange rates and interest rates applicable to the Group.  \\nThe Group believes these arrangements remain effective and \\neconomically and commercially viable hedges despite the inability  \\nto apply hedge accounting.\\n   Where hedge accounting is not applied to certain hedging \\narrangements, the reported results reflect the movement in fair value of \\nrelated derivatives due to changes in foreign exchange and interest \\nrates. In addition, at each period end, any gain or loss accruing on open \\ncontracts is recognised in the Group Income Statement for the period, \\nregardless of the expected outcome of the hedging contract on \\ntermination. This may mean that the Group Income Statement charge is \\nhighly volatile, whilst the resulting cash flows may not be as volatile. The \\nunderlying profit measure removes this volatility to help better identify \\nunderlying business performance. During 2010 there was no impact \\n(2009 – £10m) of the IAS 32 and IAS 39 charge arose in the share of \\npost-tax profit of joint ventures and associates, with the remainder in \\nfinance income/costs. \\nNote 1 Accounting policies continued\\n•   IAS 19 Income Statement charge for pensions – Under IAS 19 \\n‘Employee Benefits’, the cost of providing pension benefits in the \\nfuture is discounted to a present value at the corporate bond yield \\nrates applicable on the last day of the previous financial year. \\nCorporate bond yield rates vary over time which in turn creates \\nvolatility in the Group Income Statement and Group Balance Sheet. \\nIAS 19 also increases the charge for young pension schemes, such as \\nTesco’s, by requiring the use of rates which do not take into account \\nthe future expected returns on the assets held in the pension scheme \\nwhich will fund pension liabilities as they fall due. The sum of these \\ntwo effects can make the IAS 19 charge disproportionately higher and \\nmore volatile than the cash contributions the Group is required to \\nmake in order to fund all future liabilities. Therefore, within underlying \\nprofit we have included the ‘normal’ cash contributions for pensions \\nbut excluded the volatile element of IAS 19 to represent what the \\nGroup believes to be a fairer measure of the cost of providing post-\\nemployment benefits.\\n •  IAS 17 ‘Leases’ – impact of annual uplifts in rent and rent-free periods \\n– The amount charged to the Group Income Statement in respect of \\noperating lease costs and incentives is expected to increase significantly \\nas the Group expands its international business. The leases have been \\nstructured in a way to increase annual lease costs as the businesses \\nexpand. IAS 17 ‘Leases’ requires the total cost of a lease to be \\nrecognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, \\nirrespective of the actual timing of the cost. The impact of this \\ntreatment in 2010 was a charge of £41m (2009 – £27m) to the Group \\nIncome Statement after deducting the impact of the straight-line \\ntreatment recognised as rental income within share of post-tax profits \\nof joint ventures and associates.\\n•  IFRS 3 Amortisation charge from intangible assets arising on \\nacquisition – Under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, intangible assets \\nare separately identified and valued. The intangible assets are \\nrequired to be amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful \\neconomic lives and as such is a non-cash charge that does not reflect \\nthe underlying performance of the business acquired.\\n•  IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’ – This new interpretation \\nrequires the fair value of customer loyalty awards to be measured  \\nas a separate component of a sales transaction. The underlying profit \\nmeasure removes this fair value allocation to present underlying \\nbusiness performance, and to reflect the performance of the \\noperating segments as measured by management. \\n•  Exceptional items – Due to their significance and special nature, \\ncertain other items which do not reflect the Group’s underlying \\nperformance have been excluded from underlying profit. These gains \\nor losses can have a significant impact on both absolute profit and \\nprofit trends; consequently, they are excluded from the underlying \\nprofit of the Group. For the year ended 27 February 2010, exceptional \\nitems are as follows: \\n –  IAS 36 Impairment of goodwill arising on acquisitions – the carrying \\nvalue of goodwill relating to Japan was not fully recoverable, \\nresulting in an impairment charge of £131m (2009 – £nil), and as \\nsuch is a non-cash charge that does not reflect the underlying \\nperformance of the business. The recoverable amount for Japan \\nwas based on value in use, calculated from cash flow projections for \\nfive years using data from the Group’s latest internal forecasts, the \\nresults of which are reviewed by the Board.\\n –  Restructuring costs – These relate to certain costs associated with \\nthe Group’s restructuring activities. For the year ended 27 February \\n2010, the Group incurred £33m (2009 – £nil), relating to \\nrestructuring activities.\\nThere were no exceptional items in 2009.\\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 81 Notes to the Group financial statements continued\\nNote 2 Segmental reporting\\nIFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Group’s internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’).  \\nThe CODM has been determined to be the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors as it is primarily responsible for the allocation of resources  \\nto segments and the assessment of performance of the segments. Previously, segments were determined and presented in accordance with IAS 14 \\n‘Segment Reporting’.\\nThe CODM uses trading profit, as reviewed at monthly Executive Committee meetings as the key measure of the segments’ results as it reflects the \\nsegments’ underlying trading performance for the period under evaluation. Trading profit is a consistent measure within the Group. \\nSegmental trading profit is an adjusted measure of operating profit, which measures the performance of each segment before exceptional items \\n(goodwill impairment and restructuring charges), profit arising on property-related items, impact on leases of annual uplifts in rent and rent-free periods, \\namortisation charges from intangible assets arising on acquisition, adjustments to fair value of customer loyalty awards and replaces the IAS 19 pension \\ncharge with the ‘normal’ cash contributions for pensions.\\nOn the adoption of IFRS 8, the Group revised its operating and reporting segments. The Group’s operating segments were previously defined \\ngeographically – UK, Rest of Europe, Asia and US. The Group’s operations (retail and retailing services) are managed by geography, with Tesco Bank  \\nas a separate reporting segment because of its different regulatory environment. Accordingly, the segments under IFRS 8 are UK, Rest of Europe (ROE \\ncomprises Republic of Ireland, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Turkey), Asia (comprising Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, China, \\nJapan and India), US and Tesco Bank.\\nComparative information has been restated to reflect these new segments.\\nSegment assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated is comprised \\nmainly of derivative receivables, interest-bearing loan receivables and taxation-related assets.\\nInter-segment turnover between the operating segments is not material.\\nThe segment results for the year ended 27 February 2010, for the year ended 28 February 2009 and the reconciliation of the segment measures to the \\nrespective statutory items included in the consolidated financial information are as follows:\\n         Total at  Total \\n        Tesco constant Foreign at actual \\nYear ended 27 February 2010\\n  UK ROE Asia US Bank exchange exchange exchange\\nAt constant exchange rates  £m £m £m £m £m £m  £m £m\\nContinuing operations          \\nSales inc.

The temporary difference unrecognised at the year end amounted to \\n£2,766m (2009 – £1,726m).

A deferred tax \\nasset has been recognised in respect of £142m (2009 – £58m) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining  \\n£877m (2009 – £686m) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of £297m (2009 – £32m in \\n2013) that will expire in 2014 and £550m (2009 – £647m between 2014 and 2029) that will expire between 2015 and 2030.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at \\nwhich management monitor that goodwill.\\nRecoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. In 2010, recoverable amounts  \\nare based on value in use. Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections for generally five years using data from the Group’s latest internal \\nforecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, \\ngrowth rates and expected changes in margins. Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment  \\nof the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience \\nand expectations of future changes in the market. Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the \\nrecoverable amounts of goodwill.\\nThe carrying amount for Japan has been reduced to its recoverable amount through the recognition of an impairment loss of £131m against goodwill. \\nThis has been included in cost of sales in the Group Income Statement. The key assumptions for Japan include a long-term growth rate of 1.1%  \\n(2009 – 1.5%) and a pre-tax discount rate of 6.1% (2009 – 7.3%). \\nThe forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates of generally 1% to 4% (2009 – 2% to 10%).\\nIn the case of Poland, it is reasonably possible that a change in key assumptions would cause the goodwill to exceed its value in use.

Cash-generating units are tested for \\nimpairment if there are indications of impairment at the balance sheet date.\\nRecoverable amounts for cash-generating units are mainly based on value in use, which is generally calculated from cash flow projections for five to \\ntwenty years using data from the Group’s latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. The key assumptions for the value in \\nuse calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins. Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax \\nrates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units. Changes in selling prices \\nand direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.\\nThe forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term growth rates of generally 1% to 4% (2009 – 2% to 10%).\\nThe pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 6% to 14% (2009 – 7% to 24%) depending on the specific conditions in which each \\nstore operates.

Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes and the Group’s hedging policies are further described below. \\nFinance income of £20m (2009 – finance costs of £30m) resulted from hedge ineffectiveness.\\nFair value hedges \\nThe Group maintains interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued \\nby the Group. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group Income Statement, \\ntogether with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss on the hedging \\ninstrument and hedged item is recognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for \\nhedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is amortised to the Group Income Statement under the effective interest \\nrate method.\\nA loss of £65m on hedging instruments was recognised during the year, offset by a gain of £85m on hedged items (2009 – a gain of £1,197m on hedging \\ninstruments was offset by a loss of £1,227m on hedged items).\\nCash flow hedges\\nThe Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in \\na currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company. Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, mark-to-market gains \\nand losses are deferred in equity.\\nThe hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars. The cash flows hedged will occur and will affect the Group \\nIncome Statement within one year of the balance sheet date. \\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing  \\nin equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is recognised in the Group Income Statement. When a  \\nforecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Group \\nIncome Statement.\\nNet investment hedges \\nThe Group uses forward foreign currency contracts, currency denominated borrowings and currency swaps to hedge the exposure of a proportion of its \\nnon-Sterling denominated assets against changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.\\nThe Group has a South Korean Won denominated liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, Samsung Tesco \\nCo. Limited. This liability has been designated as a net investment hedge of a proportion of the assets of Samsung Tesco Co. Limited.\\nGains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Group Income Statement on disposal of the overseas operation.\\nFinancial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting\\nThe Group’s policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes, however, some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not \\ndesignated as a hedge where gains and losses on the hedging instrument and the hedged item offset in the Group Income Statement.\\nThese instruments include caps, interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.

These risks are managed as described below. The Group Balance Sheet position at  \\n27 February 2010 is representative of the position throughout the year.\\nRisk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board provides written \\nprinciples for risk management, as described in the Business Review on pages 41 to 44.\\nInterest rate risk\\nInterest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Debt issued at variable rates exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Debt issued at fixed \\nrates exposes the Group to fair value risk. Our interest rate management policy is explained on page 44.\\nThe Group has RPI debt where the principal is indexed to increases in the RPI index. RPI debt is treated as floating rate debt. The Group also has LPI \\ndebt, where the principal is indexed to RPI, with an annual maximum increase of 5% and a minimum of 0%. LPI debt is treated as fixed rate debt.\\nFor interest rate risk relating to Tesco Bank please refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors.\\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 105 Notes to the Group financial statements continued\\nNote 23 Financial risk factors continued\\nDuring 2010 and 2009, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows:\\n        2010   2009\\n       Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating  Total \\n         Restated Restated Restated \\n       £m £m £m £m £m £m\\nCash and cash equivalents     – 2,819 2,819 – 3,509 3,509\\nLoans and advances to customers – Tesco Bank     1,827 2,285 4,112 3,388 – 3,388 \\nLoans and advances to banks and other financial assets – Tesco Bank  144 – 144 – 1,541 1,541\\nShort-term investments       – 1,314 1,314 – 1,233 1,233\\nOther investments – Tesco Bank      581 282 863 259 – 259 \\nJoint venture loan receivables      – 309 309 – 262 262\\nFinance leases      (83) (126) (209) (84) (159) (243)\\nBank and other borrowings     (11,806) (1,258) (13,064) (11,540) (4,079) (15,619)\\nCustomer deposits – Tesco Bank     – (4,357) (4,357) – (4,538) (4,538)\\nDeposits by banks – Tesco Bank     (30) – (30) – (24) (24)\\nFuture purchases of minority interests      (146) – (146) (200) – (200)\\nDerivative effect:         \\n Interest rate swaps       (2,215) 2,215 – (415) 415 –\\n Cross currency swaps       6,677 (6,677) – 4,524 (4,524) –\\n Caps and collars      120 (120) – 774 (774) –\\nTotal        (4,931) (3,314) (8,245) (3,294)  (7,138)  (10,432) \\nCredit risk \\nCredit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, customer deposits, financial instruments and deposits with banks and \\nfinancial institutions.

Transactional exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged. \\nThese exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges. The notional and fair value of these \\ncontracts is shown in note 22.\\n•  Net investment exposure, from the value of net investments outside the UK. The Group hedges a proportion of its investments in its international \\nsubsidiaries via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are formally designated as net investment hedges.\\n•  Loans to non-UK subsidiaries. These are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are not formally \\ndesignated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset.\\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 107 Notes to the Group financial statements continued\\nNote 23 Financial risk factors continued\\nThe impact on Group financial statements from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity analysis below.\\nSensitivity analysis\\nThe analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-employment obligations and on  \\nthe retranslation of overseas net assets as required by IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’. However, it does include the foreign \\nexchange sensitivity resulting from all local entity non-functional currency financial instruments.\\nThe sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives \\nportfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at \\n27\\xa0February 2010.\\nIt should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to all financial instruments held at the balance sheet date.  \\nIt does not reflect any change in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.\\nThe following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:\\n •  the sensitivity of interest payable to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate debt, deposits and derivative instruments with no \\nsensitivity assumed for RPI-linked debt;\\n•  changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates or foreign exchange \\nrates have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt;\\n•  changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in foreign exchange rates are \\nrecorded directly in equity;\\n•  changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments only affect the Group Income Statement;\\n•  all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are fully effective with no impact on the \\nGroup Income Statement;\\n•  debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the interest payable part of the calculation; and\\n•  the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects \\na full 12-month period for the interest payable portion of the sensitivity calculations.\\nUsing the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and equity that would result from \\nchanges in UK interest rates, and in exchange rates:\\n         2010  2009\\n         Income Equity Income Equity\\n        gain/(loss) gain/(loss) gain/(loss) gain/(loss)\\n        £m £m £m £m\\n1% increase in GBP interest rates (2009 – 1%)        (38) – (59) –\\n \\n15% appreciation of the Euro (2009 – 25%)         (13) (43) (22) (22)\\n10% appreciation of the South Korean Won (2009 – 20%)       – (82)  (1) (222)\\n25% appreciation of the US Dollar (2009 – 25%)        (1) (8)  (11) 218\\n25% appreciation of the Thai Baht (2009 – 25%)        – (1)  – (1)\\n10% appreciation of the Czech Koruna (2009 – 25%)        – (31)  – (204)\\n5% appreciation of the Polish Zloty (2009 – 15%)        – –  14 –\\nA decrease in interest rates and a depreciation of foreign currencies would have the opposite effect to the impact in the table above.\\nThe impact on equity from changing exchange rates results principally from foreign currency deals used as net investment hedges. The impact on equity \\nwill largely be offset by the revaluation in equity of the hedged assets. For changes in the USD/GBP exchange rate, the impact on equity results \\nprincipally from forward purchases of US Dollars as cash flow hedges.\\nCapital risk\\nThe Group’s objectives when managing capital (defined as net debt plus equity) are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in \\norder to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while maintaining a strong credit rating and headroom whilst optimising \\nreturn to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments  \\nto it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group.\\nTo maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, buy back shares and cancel them or issue new \\nshares. In April 2006, the Group outlined its plan to release cash from its property assets, via a sequence of property joint ventures and other transactions, \\nand return significant value to shareholders, either through enhanced dividends or share buy-backs. The target for the value of share buy-backs was \\nincreased from £1.5bn to £3.0bn over a five-year period from April 2007. Whilst the Group continued with the policy at the beginning of 2009, it \\nsubsequently used the proceeds from property divestment to pay down debt, following the two major acquisitions in 2009 (Homever and Tesco Bank). \\nDuring 2009 the Group purchased and cancelled £100m ordinary shares. In the financial year 2010 the Group continued to use the proceeds from the \\nsale of property to pay down debt, which it expects to continue in 2011.\\nThe policy for debt is to ensure a smooth debt maturity profile with the objective of ensuring continuity of funding. This policy continued during the \\ncurrent year with bonds redeemed of £390m (2009 – £524m) and new bonds issued totalling £nil (2009 – £4,901m). The Group borrows centrally and \\nlocally, using a variety of capital market issues and borrowing facilities to meet the requirements of each local business.\\n108 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements\\nNote 23 Financial risk factors continued\\nTesco Bank\\nInterest rate risk\\nInterest rate risk arises where assets and liabilities in Tesco Bank’s banking activities have different repricing dates. Tesco Bank policy seeks to minimise \\nthe sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. Potential exposures to interest rate movements in the medium to long term are \\nmeasured and controlled through position and sensitivity limits. Short-term exposures are measured and controlled in terms of net interest income \\nsensitivity over 12 months to a 1% parallel movement in interest rates. Tesco Bank also use value at risk (VaR) for risk management purposes with a  \\ntime horizon of one trading day and a confidence interval of 95%. Interest rate risk is managed using interest rate swaps as the main hedging instrument.\\nCredit risk\\nCredit risk is the probability of customers and counterparties failing to meet their obligations to Tesco Bank and arises principally from Tesco Bank’s \\nlending activities but also from other transactions involving on and off-balance sheet instruments. Limits have been established for all counterparties \\nbased on their respective credit ratings. The limits and proposed counterparties are reviewed and approved by the Risk Management Committee (RMC) \\nof Tesco Bank.\\nInternal reporting and oversight of risk assets is principally differentiated by credit ratings. Internal ratings are used to assess the credit quality of \\nborrowers. Customers are assigned credit ratings, based on various credit grading models that reflect the probability of default.\\nLiquidity risk \\nLiquidity risk is managed on a consolidated basis within Tesco Bank’s banking activities and adheres to the liquidity requirements set by the Financial \\nServices Authority (FSA) from time to time. To meet regulatory requirements a diversified portfolio of high quality liquid and marketable assets is \\nmaintained. Cash flow commitments and marketable asset holdings are measured and managed on a daily basis. Tesco Bank has credit facilities sufficient \\nto meet all foreseeable outflow requirements as they fall due and its liquidity risk is further mitigated by its well diversified retail deposit base.\\nExpressed as an annual probability of default, the upper and lower boundaries and the midpoint for each of the asset quality grades are as follows:\\nAt 27 February 2010 and 28 February 2009\\n          Annual probability of default\\n        Minimum Midpoint Maximum S&P \\nAsset quality grade       % % % equivalent\\nAQ1        0.00 0.10 0.20 AAA to BBB-\\nAQ2        0.21 0.40 0.60 BB+ to BB\\nAQ3        0.61 1.05 1.50 BB- to B+\\nAQ4        1.51 3.25 5.00 B+ to B\\nAQ5        5.01 52.50 100.00 B and below\\n        Accruing  Non- Impairment  \\n   AQ1 AQ2 AQ3 AQ4 AQ5 past due accrual provision Total \\nAt 27 February 2010  £m £m £m £m £m £m £m £m £m\\nAssets:        \\nOther investments  863 – – – – – – – 863 \\nLoans and advances to customers 501 381 762 1,495 838 76 373 (314) 4,112\\nLoans and advances to banks  \\nand other financial assets  144 – – – – – – – 144\\nTotal assets    1,508  381 762 1,495 838 76 373 (314) 5,119 \\nCommitments (note 33)  3,926 1,329 573 452 184 – – – 6,464 \\nTotal off balance sheet  3,926 1,329 573 452 184 – – – 6,464 \\n        Accruing  Non- Impairment  \\n   AQ1 AQ2 AQ3 AQ4 AQ5 past due accrual provision Total \\nAt 28 February 2009 (restated) £m £m £m £m £m £m £m £m £m\\nAssets:        \\nOther investments  259 – – – – – – – 259 \\nLoans and advances to customers 352 652 828 870 563 82 291 (250) 3,388\\nLoans and advances to banks  \\nand other financial assets  1,541 – – – – – – – 1,541\\nTotal assets   2,152  652 828 870 563 82 291 (250) 5,188 \\nCommitments (note 33)  3,103 1,451 744 305 129 – – – 5,732 \\nTotal off balance sheet  3,103 1,451 744 305 129 – – – 5,732 \\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 109 Notes to the Group financial statements continued\\nNote 23 Financial risk factors continued\\nInsurance risk \\nTesco Bank is exposed to insurance risk indirectly through its profit sharing commission arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC. \\nInsurance risk is the risk of fluctuations in the timing, frequency or severity of insured events, relative to the expectations at the time of underwriting.\\nThe frequency and severity of claims and the sources of uncertainty for the key classes that Tesco Bank is exposed to are as follows:\\nMotor insurance \\nClaims experience is quite variable, due to a wide range of factors, but the principal ones are age, gender and driving experience, type and nature  \\nof vehicle, use of vehicle and area.

If this assumption increased/ \\ndecreased by 0.1%, the UK defined benefit obligation would decrease/increase by approximately £140m and the annual UK current service cost would \\ndecrease/increase by approximately £17m. \\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 113 Notes to the Group financial statements continued\\nNote 28 Post-employment benefits continued\\nUK mortality assumptions \\nThe Company conducts analysis of mortality trends under the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme in the UK as part of the triennial actuarial valuation of the \\nScheme. At the latest triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2008, the following assumptions were adopted for funding purposes:\\nBase tables:\\n PMA92C00 for male members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be one year younger than actual age.\\n PFA92C00 for female members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be half a year older than actual age.\\nThese assumptions were used for the calculation of the pension liability as at 27 February 2010 for the main UK scheme.\\nAs at 27 February 2010, the mortality assumptions have been strengthened. The base tables have been updated in line with medium cohort projections \\nwith a minimum improvement of 1% per annum from 31 March 2008 to 27 February 2010. In addition, the allowance for future mortality improvements \\nhas been changed to incorporate medium cohort projections with a minimum improvement of 1% per annum.\\nThe following table illustrates the expectation of life of an average member retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a member reaching age 65 \\nat the same date +25 years: \\n          2010 2009\\n          in years in years\\n \\nRetiring at Reporting date at age 65:  Male          21.6 21.5\\n       Female          23.4 23.3\\nRetiring at Reporting date +25 years at age 65: Male          24.0 23.9\\n       Female         25.9  25.8\\nRates of return on scheme assets \\nThe assets in the defined benefit pension schemes and the expected nominal rates of return were:\\n         2010  2009\\n        Long-term Market Long-term Market\\n        rate of return value rate of return value\\n        % £m % £m\\nEquities          8.7 2,521 8.9 1,482\\nBonds          5.1 1,233 5.5 1,080\\nProperty          7.0 343 7.3 342\\nOther (alternative assets)         8.7 484 8.9 383\\nCash          4.1 115 3.7 133\\nTotal market value of assets         4,696   3,420\\nThe expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average based on the actual plan assets held and the respective returns expected on the separate \\nasset classes.

The Group recognises provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not a settlement will be required and the value of such a payment \\ncan be reliably estimated. \\nIn September 2007, the Office of Fair Trading issued its provisional findings in its Statement of Objections relating to the alleged collusion between \\ncertain large supermarkets and dairy processors. On 30 April 2010, the Office of Fair Trading announced that it had decided to drop the allegations \\nagainst the Group in relation to milk and butter in the dairy investigation. The Office of Fair Trading agreed a discretionary penalty discount of 10%  \\nfor the Group not contesting the two remaining allegations which related to cheese. The Group has however made no admission of wrongdoing.  \\nThe discounted fine will become payable after the OFT issues its decision later this year and is immaterial to the Group and therefore no provision  \\nhas been recognised in the Group’s financial statements.\\nTesco Bank\\nAt 27 February 2010, Tesco Bank has commitments of formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend, totalling £6.5bn (2009 – \\n£5.7bn). The amount is intended to provide an indication of the potential volume of business and not of the underlying credit or other risks.\\nThe Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is the UK statutory fund of last resort for customers of authorised financial services firms  \\nand pays compensation if a firm is unable to pay claims against it. The FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury to fund these compensation costs \\nassociated with institutions that failed in 2008 and will receive receipts from asset sales, surplus cash flow and other recoveries from these institutions \\nin the future.\\nThe FSCS meets its obligations by raising management expense levies. These include amounts to cover the interest on its borrowings and compensation \\nlevies on the industry. Each deposit-taking institution contributes in proportion to its share of total protected deposits. The levy is calculated based on \\ndeposit balances held as at 31 December in each year and as such, this is seen as the ‘trigger event’ under accounting rules. \\nIf the FSCS does not receive sufficient funds from the failed institutions to repay HM Treasury in full it will raise compensation levies. At this time it is \\nnot possible to estimate the amount or timing of any shortfall resulting from the cash flows received from the failed institutions and, accordingly, no \\nprovision for compensation levies has been made in these financial statements.\\nNote 34 Capital resources \\nThe following table shows the composition of regulatory capital resources of Tesco Personal Finance PLC (being the regulated entity) at the balance \\nsheet date:\\n          2010 2009\\n              £m £m\\nTier 1 capital:           \\nShareholders’ funds and minority interests        576 521\\nTier 2 capital:         \\nQualifying subordinated debt         235 205\\nOther interests in tier 2 capital        21 19\\nSupervisory deductions          (263) (259)\\nTotal regulatory capital          569 486\\nThe movement of tier 1 capital during the year is analysed as follows:\\n          2010 2009*\\n              £m £m\\nBeginning of the year          521 514\\nShare capital and share premium        230 –\\nProfit attributable to shareholders        37 7\\nOrdinary dividends         (153) –\\nIncrease in intangible assets        (59) –\\nEnd of the year          576 521\\n* Tesco Personal Finance PLC was acquired as part of Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited on 19 December 2008.\\nIt is Tesco Personal Finance PLC’s (TPF) policy to maintain a strong capital base, to expand it as appropriate and to utilise it efficiently throughout its \\nactivities to optimise the return to shareholders while maintaining a prudent relationship between the capital base and the underlying risks of the \\nbusiness. In carrying out this policy, TPF has regard to the supervisory requirements of the Financial Services Authority (‘FSA’). The FSA uses Risk Asset \\nRatio (‘RAR’) as a measure of capital adequacy in the UK banking sector, comparing a bank’s capital resources with its risk-weighted assets (the assets \\nand off-balance sheet exposures are ‘weighted’ to reflect the inherent credit and other risks); by international agreement the RAR should be not less \\nthan 8% with a Tier 1 component of not less than 4%. TPF has complied with the FSA’s capital requirements throughout the year.\\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 119 Notes to the Group financial statements continued\\nNote 35 Leasing commitments\\nFinance lease commitments – Group as lessee\\nThe Group has finance leases for various items of plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings.

The leases have varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights. \\nThe Group has lease break options on certain sale and leaseback transactions, which are exercisable if an existing option to buy back leased assets at \\nmarket value at a specified date is also exercised, no commitment has been included in respect of the buy-back option as the option is at the Group’s \\ndiscretion. The Group is not obliged to pay lease rentals after that date and so minimum lease payments exclude those falling after the buy-back date.\\nOperating lease commitments with joint ventures \\nSince 1988, the Group has entered into several joint ventures and sold and leased back properties to and from these joint ventures. The terms of these \\nsale and leasebacks vary, however, common factors include: the sale of the properties to the joint venture at market value, options within the lease for \\nthe Group to repurchase the properties at market value, market rent reviews and 20-30 year lease terms. The Group reviews the substance  \\nas well as the form of the arrangements when making the judgement as to whether these leases are operating or finance leases; all of the leases under \\nthese arrangements are operating leases.\\nOperating lease receivables – Group as lessor\\nThe Group both rents out its properties and also sublets various leased buildings under operating leases.

Any other conditions \\nare non-vesting conditions which have to be taken into account to \\ndetermine the fair value of the equity instrument granted. This award \\nmust be treated as a cancellation where the award does not vest as a \\nresult of a failure to meet a non-vesting condition that is within the \\ncontrol of either the Company or the counterparty. Cancellations are \\ntreated as accelerated vestings and all remaining future charges are \\nimmediately recognised in the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account \\nwith the credit recognised directly in equity. The results for the year \\nended 28\\xa0February 2009 have been restated accordingly. The impact  \\non the Parent Company’s Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet  \\nis immaterial for both years.\\n•  Amendments to FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments – Disclosures’, effective \\nfor annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 required \\nenhanced disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.  \\nCurrent asset investments\\nThese relate to money market deposits which are stated at cost. All income \\nfrom these investments is included in the Parent Company Profit and Loss \\nAccount as interest receivable and similar income.\\nInvestments in subsidiaries and joint ventures\\nInvestments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are stated at cost less, where \\nappropriate, provisions for impairment.\\nForeign currencies\\nAssets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Pounds \\nSterling at the exchange rates at the end of the financial year.\\nShare-based payments\\nEmployees of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form \\nof share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services \\nin exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions) or \\nin exchange for entitlements to cash payments based on the value of the \\nshares (cash-settled transactions).\\nThe fair value of employee share option plans is calculated at the grant \\ndate using the Black-Scholes model. In accordance with FRS 20 ‘Share-\\nBased Payment’ the resulting cost is charged to the Parent Company  \\nProfit and Loss Account over the vesting period. The value of the charge  \\nis adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting. \\nWhere the Company awards options to employees of subsidiary entities, \\nthis is treated as a capital contribution.\\nFinancial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Parent \\nCompany’s Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the \\ncontractual provisions of the instrument.\\nDebtors \\nDebtors are non interest-bearing and are recognised initially at fair  \\nvalue and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest  \\nrate method, reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated \\nirrecoverable amounts.\\nInvestments \\nInvestments are classified as either held for trading or available-for-sale \\nand are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. There are  \\nno investments classified as held for trading. Gains and losses arising from \\nchanges in fair value for available-for-sale investments are recognised \\ndirectly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be \\nimpaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised \\nin equity is included in the net result for the period. \\nFinancial liabilities and equity \\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the \\nsubstance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity \\ninstrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of the \\nCompany after deducting all of its liabilities.\\nInterest-bearing borrowings \\nInterest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the \\nvalue of the amount received, net of attributable transaction costs. \\nSubsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated  \\nat amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value \\nbeing recognised in the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account over the \\nperiod of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.\\nCreditors \\nCreditors are non interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.\\nEquity instruments \\nEquity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds \\nreceived, net of direct issue costs.\\nNote 1 Accounting policies \\nT esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 123 Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued\\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting \\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure \\nto foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operating, financing \\nand investing activities. The Company does not hold or issue derivative \\nfinancial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives do not \\nqualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for as such.\\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. \\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by \\nreference to market values for similar financial instruments, by discounted \\ncash flows or by the use of option valuation models. Where derivatives do \\nnot qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement \\nare immediately recognised in the Parent Company Profit and Loss \\nAccount. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of \\nany resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship \\nand the item being hedged.\\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company is required to \\ndocument from inception the relationship between the item being hedged \\nand the hedging instrument. The Company is also required to document \\nand demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged \\nitem and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be \\nhighly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is \\nperformed at each period end to ensure that the hedge has remained \\nhighly effective.\\nDerivative financial instruments with maturity dates of more than one year \\nfrom the balance sheet date are disclosed as falling due after more than \\none year.\\nFair value hedging \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when \\nthey hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a \\nrecognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that  \\nare designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Parent \\nCompany Profit and Loss Account, together with any changes in the fair \\nvalue of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.\\nDerivative financial instruments qualifying for fair value hedge accounting \\nare principally interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.\\nCash flow hedging \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when \\nthey hedge the Company’s exposure to variability in cash flows that are \\neither attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset  \\nor liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction.\\nThe effective element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative \\ninstrument is recognised directly in equity. \\nThe associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and \\nrecognised in the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account in the same \\nperiod or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the Parent \\nCompany Profit and Loss Account. The classification of the effective \\nportion when recognised in the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account  \\nis the same as the classification of the hedged transaction. Any element  \\nof the remeasurement of the derivative instrument which does not meet \\nthe criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the Parent \\nCompany Profit and Loss Account.\\nDerivative instruments qualifying for cash flow hedging are principally \\nforward foreign exchange transactions and cross currency options.\\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or \\nis sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. \\nAt that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument \\nrecognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction \\noccurs or the original hedged item affects the Parent Company Profit and \\nLoss Account. If a forecasted hedged transaction is no longer expected to \\noccur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred  \\nto the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account.\\nNet investment hedging \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges \\nwhen they hedge the Company’s net investment in an overseas operation. \\nThe effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from \\nremeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in equity. Any \\nineffective element is recognised immediately in the Parent Company \\nProfit and Loss Account. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are \\nincluded in the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account when the foreign \\noperation is disposed of.\\nDerivative instruments qualifying for net investment hedging are principally \\nforward foreign exchange transactions and cross currency options.\\nPensions \\nThe Company participates in the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme which is a \\nmulti-employer scheme within the Tesco Group and cannot identify its \\nshare of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme. Accordingly,  \\nas permitted by FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’, the Company has accounted \\nfor the scheme as a defined contribution scheme, and the charge for the \\nperiod is based upon the cash contributions payable. \\nTaxation \\nCorporation tax payable is provided on the taxable profit for the year, using \\ntax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have \\noriginated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and would give rise \\nto an obligation to pay more or less taxation in the future.\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are recoverable. \\nThey are regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all \\navailable evidence, it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be \\nsuitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying \\ntiming differences can be deducted.\\nDeferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that \\nare expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences \\nreverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been substantively enacted \\nby the balance sheet date.\\nRecent accounting developments\\nStandards, amendments and interpretations adopted, following new \\namendments to FRS interpretations.

Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010 1\\nIt has been another significant \\nyear for our work on the \\nenvironment and within local \\ncommunities. As we grow, our \\ncustomers increasingly look to \\nTesco to take the lead in these \\nareas – and we are. \\nIn January, we opened the world’s \\nfirst zero-carbon store at Ramsey \\nin Cambridgeshire – the latest \\nstep in our journey to reduce the \\ncarbon footprint of our business. \\nOver the past year we have made \\nsignificant progress towards \\nour long-term goals by reducing \\nour emissions by 7.8% on our \\nbaseline 2006/7 store and \\ndistribution porfolio.\\nThis year we donated over \\n£60 million to charities – once \\nagain exceeding our target to \\ngive the equivalent of 1% of our \\nprofits to good causes. \\nThese good results are testament \\nto the hard work of our people. \\nThe Tesco team is now 472,000 \\nstrong – and we remain united by \\nour goal to improve the shopping \\ntrip for our customers. I would \\nlike to thank all our people for \\ntheir hard work which I know will \\ncontinue in the year ahead.\\nDavid Reid\\nChairman\\nWe have continued to grow \\nsales, profits and market share \\nover the past year. We’ve also \\nsignificantly strengthened our \\nbalance sheet.\\nOur acquisition in South Korea \\nis performing well and delivering \\nexcellent results, we’ve opened \\nour first three Tesco Lifespace \\nshopping malls in China and we \\nhave made good progress building \\nthe infrastructure and developing \\nnew products for Tesco Bank.\\nI am also pleased to announce \\nthat we again increased our \\ndividend – for the 26th consecutive \\nyear. This consistent track record \\nof delivering dividend growth \\nfor shareholders is unrivalled in \\nthe FTSE 100.\\nThe strong Group results over \\nthe last year have been achieved \\nthrough a constant focus on \\nwhat matters most to customers \\nin challenging times around the \\nworld. A good example of this \\nhas been our renewed focus on \\nrewarding loyalty – at home and \\nabroad – which has been a great \\nsuccess with customers.\\nIn the UK, we increased our \\nClubcard investment with Double \\nPoints – giving customers even \\ngreater reward for their loyalty. \\nInternationally, we launched \\nClubcard in three more countries \\nduring the year – in Poland, \\nSlovakia and Thailand – and for \\nthe first time we now have more \\nClubcard holders internationally \\nthan in the UK. \\nOver the past decade Tesco has transformed \\nitself into a diverse international business – \\nand by following our consistent strategy we \\nare well positioned for long-term growth.\\nI am pleased to report that \\nthe Tesco team has once \\nagain delivered a good set of \\nresults – guided by experienced \\nmanagement who have steered \\nthe business through recessions \\nbefore. As markets around the \\nworld are emerging from this \\nrecession each part of our \\nbusiness is well positioned to \\npursue our strategy for growth. 2 Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010\\n01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 2010\\n472\\n237\\n01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 2010\\n94\\n28\\nInternational\\nUK\\nA growth business...\\nPeople\\n(000s)\\n472,000\\nSales area\\n(m sq ft)\\n94m sq ft\\n01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 2010\\n94\\n28\\nInternational\\nUK Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010 3\\nOur position amongst the leading global retailers  \\nhasn’t happened by chance.

In our core \\ngrocery operations, we’re growing \\nahead of the industry as a whole \\nand we have been less affected  \\nby falling inflation than the market \\nat large.\\nIn Non-food we have made good \\nprogress. In the UK we achieved a \\nparticularly strong performance in \\nelectricals, entertainment and toys. \\nOur clothing range is becoming \\nan international success, led by \\nour F&F range which is growing \\nrapidly in our European markets \\nand this year was launched in  \\nfour countries in Asia. \\nOur Retailing Services have \\ngrown sales and profits once \\nagain. We’ve also been building \\nthe platforms for future growth, \\nparticularly in Tesco Bank, which \\nis making good progress in \\ndeveloping its own systems and \\npeople capabilities as well as \\nworking on a broader product \\nrange as it moves towards \\nbecoming a full-service retail bank.\\nIn the same way that we’ve stuck  \\nto our strategy in other parts of  \\nthe business, we’ve also remained \\ncommitted to our work on \\nCommunity and the environment. \\nIn October, we set ourselves three \\nchallenging long-term targets:  \\nto become a zero-carbon business  \\nby 2050; to reduce the carbon \\nimpact of the products in our \\nsupply chain by 30% by 2020;  \\nand to help our customers halve \\ntheir own carbon footprint by \\n2020.

It was laid \\ndown in 1997, with the fifth element – Community – being \\nadded in 2007. Many of the new businesses that have \\nbeen created and developed over the last 13 years as  \\npart of this strategy are now of significant scale and highly \\nprofitable – in fact we are now market leader in many  \\nof our markets outside the UK. In 1997 our International \\nbusiness generated 1.8% of the Group’s profits and we \\nhad only just entered the Retailing Services markets;  \\ntoday these parts of our business represent 22% and  \\n16% of profits respectively.\\nImportantly, the strategy has given the business momentum \\nto grow well through the economic downturn. By continuing \\nto invest through the recession – in the customer offer, in \\ninfrastructure and in our people – we are now well placed  \\nto grow faster and improve shareholder returns as the global \\neconomic environment improves.

By reducing costs \\nand lowering prices for customers \\nand by continuing to invest in new \\nspace we have made market share \\ngains across our markets.\\nA good example is Ireland where \\nwe have made substantial \\nchanges to our business, which \\nwas facing the dual challenge  \\nof a severe recession and cross-\\nborder trading. By integrating \\nmore of our international brand \\nbuying with our UK business we \\nhave been able to reduce the \\nprices of 12,500 products by an \\naverage of around 20%. \\nIn the United States, Fresh & Easy \\nhas been making good progress, \\ndespite prolonged weakness in the \\nCalifornia, Nevada and Arizona \\neconomies.

Our \\nbusinesses have made good \\nprogress – delivering for \\ncustomers today and at the \\nsame time investing in the \\ndrivers of future growth.  \\nOur strategy is working –  \\nand we ended this year \\nstronger than we started it.\\nEach of our businesses has \\nadapted itself to the demands of \\nits local market – with strong local \\nmanagement teams finding ways \\nto lower costs and deliver great \\nvalue for customers. Increasingly \\nour international businesses are \\nalso utilising the scale and skill  \\nof the Tesco Group – with more \\ninternational sourcing, Discount \\nBrands now in seven markets,  \\nF&F clothing now in ten countries, \\nClubcard introduced in seven \\ncountries with more Clubcard \\nholders internationally than in the \\nUK – and the Tesco Operating \\nModel sharing our global best \\npractice to the benefit of all  \\nour businesses.\\nWith clear signs that our \\ninternational markets are starting  \\nto recover we are planning to \\nresume a faster pace of new  \\nspace opening in the coming year. \\nIn 2009/10 we opened 5.1m sq ft  \\nof new space and in 2010/11 we \\nwill open 8.5m sq ft in addition  \\nto nine shopping malls in  \\nChina.

We’ve found it hard to \\nfind locations with the right facilities in \\nsome cities – giving us an opportunity \\nto develop our own malls, to ensure \\nthey are the right size, location and \\ndesign to meet the needs of the new \\nChinese consumer.\\nDuring the year we opened our first \\nthree Tesco Lifespace shopping malls  \\nin Fushun (pictured), Qingdao and \\nQinhuangdao and we will open nine \\nmore this year. Each mall comprises \\napproximately 500,000 sq ft of retail \\nspace over five floors and is a one- \\nstop destination providing shopping \\n(including a 100,000 sq ft Tesco \\nhypermarket), entertainment, dining \\nand leisure. \\nWe are partnering with investors to share \\nthe capital commitment on some of \\nthese projects, enabling us to roll out \\nmore sites faster.

Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010 15\\nCustomers earned \\n£550m in Clubcard \\nvouchers\\nClubcard is our unique way of saying \\nthank you to our customers for \\nshopping with us. Launched in 1995, \\nClubcard now has 15 million active \\nmembers in the UK. Clubcard not only \\nrewards our customers for their loyalty, \\nbut it also provides us with valuable \\ninsight into changing shopping patterns. \\nBy monitoring this data and spotting \\ntrends early we’re able to respond \\nquickly and ensure that we’re always \\nproviding customers with what they \\nwant, when and where they want it.\\nThis year Clubcard became even more \\nrewarding. By increasing our investment \\nwith Double Points, customers earned \\n£550 million in total in vouchers. \\nDouble Points has encouraged more \\ncustomers to sign up, a Clubcard is  \\nnow used with a higher proportion  \\nof transactions than before and \\nClubcard – 15 years of loyalty \\n18% more UK households are \\nredeeming vouchers than a year ago.\\nThe knowledge and expertise of \\noperating Clubcard – combined with \\ninsight and analysis from dunnhumby –  \\nis now being adopted across our \\ninternational businesses. We now have \\nClubcard in seven of our international \\nmarkets – in fact we now have more \\nClubcard holders overseas than in  \\nthe UK.\\nQuality – particularly in fresh food  \\n– remains important to customers \\neven in tough times and as we \\nemerge from recession this will \\nbecome even more important. \\nThat’s why we have been investing \\nin our fresh food offer with a  \\nwide-ranging change programme. \\nImproved technical standards, \\nadditional specialist staff training, \\ncloser relationships with our \\nsuppliers and significant changes  \\nto the way we merchandise some \\nkey products are helping us \\ndeliver a stronger range and \\nbetter shopping experience for \\ncustomers. These and other \\ninitiatives helped Tesco win the \\n‘Fresh Produce Retailer of the \\nYear’ Award in 2009.\\ntransactions, continue to keep us \\nahead of the industry on customer \\nmeasures of checkout service. We \\ntrained more than 200,000 staff  \\nto help them respond better to \\ncustomer needs and our ‘Every \\nComment Helps’ initiative, which \\nencourages customers to give \\ninstant feedback via text or email, \\nhas given us the benefit of 60,000 \\ncustomer comments to help us \\nimprove our offer and service. \\nTesco’s diverse and adaptable \\nrange allows us to offer a wide \\nchoice for every customer whatever \\ntheir budget. Through the recession \\nwe have helped customers with \\nlower-priced ranges such as \\nDiscount Brands and Market Value \\nand we have also offered them \\naffordable treats such as the Finest \\nRestaurant Collection ready meals, \\nwhich have been very popular.  \\nWe continue to innovate our range \\nwith over 2,600 new or improved \\nown-label food lines launched  \\nthis year.\\nOur strategy of earning \\ncustomers’ loyalty by helping \\nthem to spend less – with low \\nprices and affordable new \\nproducts such as the Discount \\nBrands – deflated sales growth \\ninitially but it was the right \\nthing to do for customers. \\nBy encouraging and rewarding \\nloyalty – through an increased \\ninvestment in Clubcard – we have \\nmaintained steadier sales growth \\nduring the year than the industry \\nas a whole, which has seen \\nsignificant slowdown with the \\nsteep decline in inflation.\\nWhilst focusing on lowering prices \\nand offering great promotions  \\nhas been a real priority during the \\nrecession, delivering for customers \\nis also about providing an ‘Every \\nlittle helps’ shopping trip. That’s \\nwhy we have continued to invest \\nin availability, service, range  \\nand quality.\\nWe understand how important  \\nit is to our customers that their \\nfavourite items are available every \\ntime they shop. Over the past year \\nwe have introduced a number of \\nnew initiatives to improve stock \\nmanagement and reduce further \\nthe number of gaps on our shelves. \\nBy developing more efficient \\nordering systems, introducing better \\nin-store monitoring processes and \\nchanging the way we store our stock \\nwe have reduced evening gaps in \\nfresh food by 18%. \\nWe’ve also stayed ahead of our \\ncompetitors on key customer \\nservice measures. Our one-in-front \\ninitiative – where if there is more \\nthan one customer queuing at a \\nsingle checkout we open another – \\nand increased investment in self-\\nservice checkouts, which now \\naccount for a quarter of all \\nCore UK Our market-leading UK business has \\ncontinued to grow well by helping customers  \\nto spend less during the downturn 16 Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010\\nF&F – a global brand\\nOur ambition is to make F&F a  \\nleading global fashion brand, offering \\nunbeatable value for money, not \\ncompromised by quality, design  \\nor provenance.\\nF&F launched in the UK in 2001 and \\nhas expanded rapidly since then with \\nsales last year of £540 million in the  \\nUK – supported by the launch of our \\nonline clothing site in October. \\nF&F launched in Central Europe in 2008 \\nand we’re already making excellent \\nprogress. F&F is rapidly becoming \\nestablished in the region with customer \\nawareness of the brand growing from \\n34% to 61% in the last year. \\nAcross our markets in Central Europe, \\nTesco is already one of the largest \\nclothing retailers. In fact during the \\nyear we sold more F&F items – \\n68\\xa0million – than the combined \\npopulations of our four countries in  \\nthe region: Poland; Hungary; Czech \\nRepublic; and Slovakia. \\nWe’re now building on the success in \\nthe UK and Central Europe to launch \\nF&F across our Asian markets. This year \\nwe launched in China, Malaysia, South \\nKorea and Thailand. \\nAs with any brand, F&F can’t afford to \\nstand still, which is why we’re broadening \\nthe brand’s appeal with new ranges – \\nF&F Couture and F&F Jewellery.\\n•  www.tesco.com/clothing \\ncombines familiar Tesco labels – \\nsuch as Cherokee and F&F – with \\nnew Tesco lines offered exclusively \\nonline, plus a number of other \\nbrands. It became one of the top \\nten most visited clothing websites \\nwithin a few weeks of its launch;\\n•  www.tesco.com/entertainment \\nhas brought together, for the \\nfirst time, our entire physical and \\ndigital entertainment offer, in a \\nnew and easy to use one-stop \\nsite. Customers can buy a CD, \\nDVD or game and a film or \\nalbum download, all in one \\ntransaction. From the outset  \\nthe new site has proved popular \\nwith customers.\\nWe are also bringing global scale \\nand skill to our non-food business. \\nFor example, in Europe, the use of \\njoint buying for clothing – whereby \\n95% of the supplier base in Central \\nEurope is the same as Ireland and \\nthe UK – enables us to reduce \\nsupply chain costs, helping us to \\nmaximise quality whilst minimising \\nprices for customers. \\nShopping habits are changing – \\ncustomers want to buy online as \\nwell as from stores and catalogues \\n– and many will use a combination  \\nof these to research before buying. \\nWith an integrated multichannel \\napproach we’re making it easy for \\ncustomers, whichever way they \\nwant to shop. In addition to the \\n15,500 products available online \\nthrough Tesco Direct, we now  \\nhave two new specialist websites \\nlaunched in October: \\nBy remaining focused on \\nproviding customers with \\nexcellent quality and value, our \\nnon-food business has been \\nresilient through the downturn. \\nIn some key categories we have \\nmade significant market share \\ngains as more customers have \\nbeen encouraged to try our  \\nnon-food range in the search  \\nfor great value and as some \\ncompetitors have felt the strain. \\nWith our growing range in-store, \\ncustomers are recognising the \\nconvenience of buying non-food \\nitems with their weekly groceries, \\nrather than making a special trip  \\nto the high street. Our sales in toys, \\nfor example, continue to grow \\nrapidly – up 25% this year.\\nIn entertainment products, we’re \\nreducing prices and differentiating \\nour range by signing deals directly \\nwith film studios. This year we \\nsigned a groundbreaking deal with \\nDreamWorks for the exclusive \\nrights to the short animated film \\nMerry Madagascar, which sold over \\none million copies over Christmas.\\nIn some areas, such as electricals, \\ncustomers are looking for specialist, \\nimpartial advice. That’s why we \\nnow employ over 1,000 specially \\ntrained Tesco Tech Support \\nadvisors in our largest stores in the \\nUK. This team has helped Tesco \\ndouble turnover in electricals in the \\nlast four years; we now sell one in \\nevery six microwaves in the UK and \\none in four small-screen TVs. \\nNon-food Our general merchandise offer is growing  \\nin sophistication with improved ranges and \\nprices, more global sourcing and a stronger \\nonline presence Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010 17\\nT esco \\nworks  \\n for me...\\n“ ...everything is in one \\n  location – I just bought \\n  a washing line”\\nSasha with Schmoo\\nTesco customer\\nFriern Barnet\\nWatch the video:\\nwww.tesco.com/tescoworksforme 18 Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010\\n“ ...I have my cat\\n  insured with T esco \\n  – they were very \\n  reasonable” \\nSue with Lexi\\nTesco customer\\nMuswell Hill\\nWatch the video:\\nwww.tesco.com/tescoworksforme\\nT esco \\nworks  \\n for me...

Full details can be found in the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010. 26 Tesco PLC Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement 2010\\nGroup financials\\nThese results are for the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2010. In the last full financial year, we reported a 53-week period for the UK, Republic of Ireland and the \\nUnited States (US) and a 52-week period for the rest of the Group. Growth rates in these results are expressed for the UK, Republic of Ireland and US to coincide \\nwith the comparable 52 weeks last year.\\nStatutory numbers include the adoption of IFRIC 13 (Customer Loyalty Programmes). All other numbers are shown excluding IFRIC\\xa013, consistent with internal \\nmanagement reporting. More information can be found in note 1 to the Group financial statements in the Annual Report and Financial Statements.\\nGroup sales, including VAT, increased by 6.8% to £62.5 billion. At constant exchange rates, sales increased by 6.1% (including petrol) and 7.7% (excluding petrol).\\nUnderlying profit before tax rose to £3,395 million, an increase of 10.1%. Group trading profit was £3,412 million, up 12.3% on last year and Group trading \\nmargin, at 5.9%, rose 25 basis points. These were helped by the fact that Tesco Bank was fully consolidated in 2010 and accounted for as a joint venture for most \\nof 2009.\\nGroup operating profit rose by 10.7% to £3,457 million. Group profit before tax increased 10.4% to £3,176 million.\\nOn a statutory 52-week basis (compared to 53 weeks last year), Group operating profit rose by 9.1% to £3,457 million and Group profit before tax rose by 8.9% \\nto £3,176m.\\nCash flow and balance sheet Tesco liquidity has improved significantly during the year through strong cash generation, tight control of capex and working \\ncapital improvements arising from better inventory management. Net debt has consequently reduced by £1.7 billion to £7.9 billion.\\nExcluding the effects of currency fluctuations, we expect to reduce net debt to £7.5 billion by the end of the 2010/11 financial year.\\nThe strength of our property backed balance sheet was further demonstrated with profitable market leading sale and leaseback transactions.\\nGroup capital expenditure was £3.1 billion (last year £4.7 billion). This reduced level of spend was achieved whilst still delivering 8% growth in Group selling \\nspace. This year we plan to invest around £3.5 billion in capital expenditure.\\nExcluding Tesco Bank, cash flow from operating activities totalled £5.4 billion (£5.1 billion in 2009), including a £0.6 billion improvement in working capital.\\nFinance costs and tax Net finance costs, after net favourable IFRS adjustments of £103 million*, reduced to £314 million (£356 million last year on a consistent \\n52-week basis). A reduction in the underlying interest charge is expected next year. Total Group tax has been charged at an effective rate of 26.4% (last year \\n26.7%). We expect the tax rate in 2010/11 to be around 26%.\\nDividend Underlying diluted earnings per share increased by 9.2% to 16.62p in the second half, calculated using a constant tax rate. The Board has approved a \\nfinal dividend of 9.16p per share, taking the full-year dividend to 13.05p. This represents an increase of 9.1% on last year’s full-year dividend which is in line with \\nthe growth in underlying diluted earnings per share at constant exchange rates. The final dividend will be paid on 9 July 2010 to shareholders on the Register of \\nMembers at the close of business on 30 April 2010.\\nProperty We are continuing to release value created through the long-term development of our property portfolio. In the year we completed deals with total \\nproceeds of £1.8bn and we expect to divest a similar amount this year. The strong demand for these assets and the good yields achieved (initial yields between 5.0% \\nand 5.2% for stores) demonstrate the strong underlying value of our property and the strength of the Tesco covenant. Profits from property in the year were £377m. \\nOur property mix remains strong – over 70% of our property is freehold – supported by substantial new capital investment in freehold assets each year. Our latest \\nproperty assets valuation of £34.6bn reflects recent firming yields across the market and confirms that our assets are worth well in excess of their book value.\\nPension Our award-winning defined-benefit career-average pension scheme is an important part of our competitive benefits package, which helps Tesco recruit \\nand retain the best people. In the UK we have 160,000 employees in the scheme. As at February 2010, under the IAS 19 methodology of pension liability valuation, \\nthe scheme had a deficit on a post-tax basis of £1.3bn, compared to £1.4bn at the half year. The last actuarial valuation of the scheme’s assets and liabilities \\nshowed a small and manageable deficit.\\nReturn on capital employed We have continued to invest during the recession, which has put pressure on returns in the short term but is enabling us to make \\ngood progress in all our markets. During the financial year 2010 our post-tax return on capital employed (ROCE) fell from 12.8%** to 12.1%.\\nHaving raised ROCE from 10.2% in 2003 to 12.6% in 2006, we committed in April 2006 to increase ROCE a further 200 basis points to 14.6%. We are \\nreaffirming this commitment with confidence that with the prospect of an improving global economy and recent significant investments in acquisitions and new \\nspace making a greater contribution going forward, returns will improve in the coming few years, starting in 2010/11.\\nThe Summary Financial Statement on pages 27 and 28 and the Summary Report of the Directors on pages 24 and 25 are a summary of information in the \\nAnnual Report and Financial Statements 2010.

Turnover and pre-tax profits for \\nthe year, which include the six month\\ncontribution from our acquisition, were\\n£8.3m and £1.5m respectively (2003:\\n£6.3m and £2.2m). Basic earnings per\\nshare were 3.02p (2003: 4.54p).\\nThe Group’s major achievement this year\\nhas been the successful acquisition and\\nintegration of Seravac Biotech (Proprietary)\\nLimited and its subsidiary (“Seravac”).\\nSeravac was established in Cape Town in\\n1955 and is a significant supplier of\\nnaturally derived enzymes to markets\\nincluding the diagnostic, pharmaceutical,\\nbiotechnology, and research industries. \\nThis acquisition has consolidated the\\nGroup’s existing position as one of the\\nworld’s leading producers and suppliers of\\ndiagnostic enzymes. It has also extended \\nthe range of products with therapeutic\\npotential. Jacobus de Kock, one of the\\nformer vendors of Seravac, is now Executive\\nChairman of Seravac and we are delighted\\nto welcome him onto the Theratase Board\\nas a Non-Executive Director.\\nThe acquisition was funded by way of a\\nPlacing and Open Offer, and through a new\\nsenior debt facility. At the same time we\\nwere able to redeem the Company’s\\noutstanding Preference shares. Through\\nthis early redemption we have been able \\nto maximise shareholder value, simplify \\nthe Company’s capital structure, and\\nmanage more efficiently the maturity of \\nour funding commitments.\\nThe Group has also made progress with its\\ntherapeutic projects. In February 2004, we\\nannounced a new joint venture investment\\nin a Swedish biopharmaceutical company,\\nApplet, with Pharmalink, a Swedish\\nspeciality pharmaceutical company.\\nTheratase and Pharmalink will each invest\\napproximately £0.5m in the joint venture,\\ncontingent upon achieving development\\nmilestones. At 30 September 2004,\\n£0.1m had already been invested by the\\nGroup in the project. Applet will initially\\ndevelop therapeutics using the enzyme\\nhyaluronidase for use as an anti-oedema\\nand anti-inflammatory agent in the\\nprevention of transplant rejection. The\\nGroup’s UK based subsidiary, Biozyme\\nLaboratories, will ultimately supply\\nhyaluronidase to the venture on the \\nbasis that development is successful. \\nIn January 2004, we agreed to make \\na further investment, in the form of a\\n€200,000 convertible loan in AM-Pharma\\nHoldings BV (“ AM-Pharma”), the Dutch \\njoint venture founded in 2000 to develop\\ntherapeutics and diagnostic treatments for\\nsepsis and microbial infections. Theratase\\nmade the investment on 2 December 2004\\nfollowing the successful achievement of the\\nrequired technical milestone by AM-Pharma.\\nThis investment, which is part of a larger\\nfund raising initiative by AM-Pharma to raise\\na minimum of €1.75m, is to fund extended\\nPhase IIa clinical trials using alkaline\\nphosphatase, supplied by Biozyme, in sepsis\\npatients. The commencement of these trials\\nwas temporarily delayed by an ethical review\\nrelating to patient informed consent which\\nhave now been resolved. It is now\\nanticipated that trial results will be\\navailable by the third quarter of 2005. \\nAn important technical milestone \\nwas achieved in May when ISTA\\nPharmaceuticals announced that it had\\nreceived US FDA approval for the use of\\nVitrase\\n®\\nas a spreading agent. Biozyme\\nproduces the active pharmaceutical\\ningredient, hyaluronidase, for Vitrase\\n®\\n. \\nThis approval enables ISTA to sell Vitrase\\n®\\nto ophthalmologists needing to facilitate\\nspreading of other drugs in the eye. \\nThis represents an important event for\\nBiozyme’s manufacturing facility, which was\\naudited successfully by the FDA in 2003.\\nOn behalf of the Board I would like to\\nwelcome our new employees in South\\nAfrica to the Group and to thank them as\\nwell as all of our UK and USA employees\\nfor their efforts which are so important to\\nthe continued success of the Group. 2004\\nhas been a year of great change for the\\nGroup with new opportunities introduced\\nand a broadening of our offerings. I look\\nforward to the challenges ahead in\\nimproving profitability and seeking out\\nfurther appropriate opportunities.\\nPhilip Percival\\nChairman\\n18 January 2005\\n“The last 12 months have been a time of considerable\\ndevelopment and change for the Group. We have\\nsucceeded in making major advances in progressing\\nthe Group’s strategy which is to build a specialist\\npharma/diagnostics company through organic growth,\\nappropriate synergistic acquisitions, and by investing \\nin research and development through therapeutic joint\\nventures. The Group’s operations have continued to be\\nprofitable and cash generative.” \\nPhilip Percival, Chairman “Achieving GMP \\ncompliance \\nunderlines \\nour strategy \\nof achieving \\nmaximum\\nvalue for \\nshareholders”\\nANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 THERATASE PLC 05\\nBiozyme\\nDiagnostic\\nBiozyme’s most important products\\ncontinue to be glucose oxidase and\\nalkaline phosphatase. Over many \\nyears Biozyme has established solid\\nrelationships with some of the major\\nplayers in the diagnostics market\\nincluding Lifescan Europe (a subsidiary \\nof Johnson & Johnson) which is one of\\nthe main customers for glucose oxidase,\\nwhich is incorporated into home blood\\nglucose testing kits. This market is\\ngrowing at a rate of over 10% per \\nannum due to the increasing incidence \\nof diabetes worldwide. Alkaline\\nphosphatase, which is manufactured \\nfrom bovine intestine, is a key enzyme\\nused extensively in immunodiagnostic\\ntesting for the diagnosis of disease and\\nmonitoring of physiological change. It is\\nalso used in pathology and organ function\\ntests. During the last year considerable\\nefforts, alongside DEFRA (Department \\nof the Environment, Farming, and Rural\\nAffairs) have been made to ensure that\\nour manufacture and supply of alkaline\\nphosphatase continues to meet the \\nlatest EU regulations. Other enzymes \\nfor which Biozyme holds a strong market\\nreputation include hyaluronidase,\\nribonuclease and urease.\\nTherapeutic\\nThe core business and the sales it\\ngenerates through the diagnostics \\nmarket are critically important for \\nthe Group’s financial performance.\\nAdditionally Biozyme and Seravac, \\nthe recently acquired South African\\nbusiness, together represent a platform\\nfor Theratase to grow into new markets. \\nBiozyme has, through its excellent\\nproduction skills and product specification\\nprofiles, enabled Theratase to access\\nexciting pharmaceutical product\\ndevelopment programmes which\\nincorporate enzymes produced by the\\ncompany as active pharmaceutical\\nintermediates (APIs). In this respect, the\\nrecent rating of one of the manufacturing\\nunits within Biozyme by the US FDA as\\ncompliant with Good Manufacturing\\nPractice (GMP) enables the in-house\\nexpertise to be employed to maximum\\nadvantage in the new development\\nprojects in which the company is\\nengaged. GMP compliance is necessary\\nfor the regulatory approval of therapeutic\\nproducts and/or their components.\\nAchieving GMP compliance underlines \\nour strategy of achieving maximum value\\nfor shareholders by exploiting Biozyme’s\\ncore skills base and developing this along\\nultimately more lucrative lines such as \\nthe production of substantially higher\\nmargin enzymes as APIs.\\nThe company is engaged in the following\\nAPI programmes exploiting the enzymes \\nit produces for therapeutic applications.\\nOrgan transplant rejection \\nTheratase recently announced the\\nformation of a new joint venture, Applet\\nMBJ AB (“Applet”), established with the\\nSwedish speciality pharmaceutical\\ncompany, Pharmalink. Each company\\nplans to invest £0.5m in return for a\\nChief Executive’s Review\\n“The acquisition of Seravac has broadened the Group’s\\nturnover, product, and manufacturing bases, and a \\nnew therapeutic programme has been commenced. \\nThe Group will be concentrating its efforts over the next\\nyear on improving profitability at Seravac as well as\\ncontinuing to seek out appropriate therapeutic\\nopportunities to fuel growth.”\\nJohn Chesham, Chief Executive 06 THERATASE PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004\\nChief Executive’s Review continued\\n47.5% stake in the JV. Theratase will be\\nmaking its payments in four tranches over\\na 14 month period, which commenced \\nin February 2004, on the achievement \\nof development-related milestones. \\nAt year end the Group had invested\\n£0.1m. Applet is exploring the use of\\nhyaluronidase for its potential to reduce\\norgan transplant rejection. Currently, there\\nis no effective strategy for controlling\\nrejection within the first 24 hours of\\norgans transplanted into patients. Applet\\nintends to take hyaluronidase through \\nthe pre-clinical stage and into phase I \\nand II clinical trials. Intellectual property\\ngenerated through the work will be owned\\nby Applet. It is believed that hyaluronidase\\ncould be used in all transplanted organs\\n(liver, kidney, heart, lung) prior to surgical\\ninterventions to minimise the risk of acute\\nphase rejections. \\nOphthalmic applications\\nThe Group supplies ISTA Pharmaceuticals\\nInc. with hyaluronidase for use in its drug\\nVitrase\\n®\\n. Vitrase\\n®\\nhas been approved by\\nthe US FDA for use as a spreading agent.\\nThis approval means that for the first time\\nBiozyme will be manufacturing product\\nwhich will ultimately be used in a clinical\\nsetting. During the year Biozyme entered\\ninto a new three year supply agreement\\nwith ISTA. In addition, Biozyme granted\\nISTA a technology licence to manufacture\\nhyaluronidase. In consideration of this\\nISTA has agreed to pay Biozyme a fee of\\n$1.1m in instalments payable over three\\nyears, of which $368,000 had been\\nreceived in 2004. Whilst Biozyme has left\\nthe door open for the negotiation of a\\nnew contract it does not anticipate,\\nparticularly if ISTA fails to get Vitrase\\n®\\napproved for vitreous haemorrhage,\\nsupplying ISTA with product beyond\\nAugust 2007. This has clear benefits \\nto Biozyme freeing up its GMP facility \\nto pursue higher value projects. \\nSepsis and septic shock\\nAM-Pharma is a joint venture in which\\nTheratase holds approximately 9% of the\\nequity. The venture was established in\\n2001 to evaluate the role of alkaline\\nphosphatase in the treatment of sepsis\\nand septic shock. At 30 September 2004\\nTheratase had invested £1.0m in cash\\nand in-kind contributions, which has\\nassisted AM-Pharma’s clinical progress.\\nAlkaline phosphatase represents a potential\\nmajor market for AM-Pharma. In addition to\\nthe equity stake the Group has an exclusive\\nsupply agreement following eventual\\napproval of the product. The programme\\nhas progressed well and has obtained\\nethics committee approval to commence\\nan extended Phase IIa clinical trial in sepsis\\npatients. The Phase I and IIa data obtained\\nto date in the small number of healthy\\nvolunteers indicate the product is safe and\\nwell tolerated. The first small Phase IIa\\nstudy using simulated sepsis (created \\nby giving volunteers low doses of LPS)\\nachieved its main aim of demonstrating \\nthe potential of alkaline phosphatase to\\nhold back the development of the early\\nsymptoms of septic shock. It is expected\\nthat clinical data from the Phase IIa study \\nin 50–60 patients could be available \\nin the second half of 2005.\\nGlucose Oxidase\\nSource: Apergillus niger\\nA highly purified salt free freeze dried powder with a specific activity (Grade GO3A) of\\nthe order of 360U/mg protein (approx 270U/mg material).

The company\\nis currently in the process of obtaining\\nregistration with the US FDA for Good\\nManufacturing Practice.Seravac has\\nhistorically committed minimal resources \\nto marketing and the Board believes that\\nthe application of Theratase’s marketing\\nexperience has and will over time enhance\\nSeravac’s market position and pricing\\npower. Due to the minimal customer\\noverlap, opportunities for cross-selling \\nand joint marketing initiatives are being\\nidentified, particularly in the USA, the most\\nimportant market for Biozyme. Seravac\\nmanufactures pharmaceutical and\\ndiagnostic enzymes. Its products may \\nbe split into two groups: animal derived\\nenzymes and plant derived enzymes.\\nAnimal derived enzymes\\nThis category includes various proteases,\\nwhich are enzymes extracted from bovine\\npancreas, and hyaluronidase, which is \\nan enzyme extracted from bovine or \\novine testes. The main products are\\ndeoxyribonuclease, chymotrypsin, \\nand chymotrypsinogen which are used \\nas anti-inflammatory agents as well as\\ndigestive aids.\\nPlant derived enzymes\\nThe main product in this category is\\nperoxidase which is extracted from\\nhorseradish roots and is used in conjunction\\nwith glucose oxidase to monitor glucose\\nlevels in diabetics and as an indicator in\\nimmunodiagnostics to monitor diseases.\\nIntegration of Seravac\\nIn the six months since acquisition\\nexcellent progress has been made in\\nintegrating Seravac into the Group. The\\noperations of Seravac USA have been\\ncombined with those of Biozyme’s US\\noperations, and Seravac’s US office \\nhas been closed. Some management\\nchanges have been made in Cape Town\\nto improve the management structure.\\nJoint marketing initiatives have\\ncommenced and changes have been\\nmade to technical/marketing websites \\nto facilitate cross-selling.

However it is recognised that these systems are\\ndesigned to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure \\nto achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable,\\nbut not absolute, assurance against material misstatement \\nor loss and eliminating the risk of failure to achieve \\nbusiness objectives.\\nAs prescribed in the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on\\ninternal control an ongoing process has been established for\\nidentifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced\\nby the Group. This process has been in place throughout the\\nyear in review and up to the date of the approval of the annual\\nreport and accounts.\\nThe Board has established a risk management committee\\n(the “Risk Committee”) chaired by Dr Aikman, which includes\\nMr Anderson and Ms Rooke.

For this reason, they continue to adopt\\nthe going concern basis in preparing the accounts.\\nCompliance with the Combined Code\\nDuring the year ended 30 September 2004 the Company has\\nbeen in compliance with the requirements of the Combined\\nCode in place during the year except in the following areas:\\n• The Audit Committee comprises of two independent Non-\\nExecutive Directors and not at least three as is required. \\nThis reflects the current size of the Group.\\n• The Board believes that given its size and constitution it is\\nnot appropriate to specify a “senior” Non-Executive Director \\nor to appoint a nomination committee. 18 THERATASE PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004\\nCompliance\\nThis report by the Remuneration Committee sets out the\\nCompany’s policy on the remuneration of Directors together \\nwith details of the Directors’ remuneration packages and service\\ncontracts.

Mr Percival is also\\nChairman of the Board. The role of the Committee includes:\\n• Determining and agreeing with the Board, the Group’s policy\\non the remuneration of, benefits and terms of employment of\\nthe Executive Directors and certain senior Group employees;\\n• Approving the design of, targets for, and payments made,\\nunder performance related pay schemes;\\n• Reviewing the design for share incentive plans for approval \\nby the Board and shareholders and overseeing the operation\\nof share incentive schemes.\\nThe Executive Directors are responsible for the remuneration \\nof the Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman.\\nThe Committee has not appointed nor sought advice from any\\nconsultants to advise on remuneration issues, however legal\\nadvice on such matters has been provided to the Committee\\nduring the period. The Committee takes into consideration the\\nExecutive Directors’ Remuneration in the Techmark Companies\\nReport in determining appropriate levels of remuneration.\\nThe Committee consults the Chief Executive concerning the\\nremuneration of the other Executive Directors and senior Group\\nemployees and the Chief Executive is invited to attend the\\nCommittee’s meetings but is not present when his own\\nremuneration is being discussed.\\nThe Committee meets usually at least twice a year.\\nRemuneration policy\\nThe objectives of the remuneration policy for Executive Directors\\nare that:\\n• The total remuneration package should be competitive \\nwith companies in the same sector which are of similar \\nsize so that it will attract, retain and motivate Executives \\nwith the skills and calibre required to maximise return \\nfor shareholders;\\n• Remuneration should align the interests of Executives with\\nthose of shareholders through the use of performance driven\\ncash based awards and share options in addition to base\\nsalary and benefits;\\n•Performance targets should be challenging; and\\n• The details of each element of remuneration should be clear\\nand easily understood.\\nThe components of the remuneration of the Executive Directors\\nare as follows:\\nBase salary\\nIndividual base salaries are reviewed annually by the\\nCommittee, taking into account a number of factors, including\\nindividual performance, responsibility changes, and Company\\nperformance. Base salary is also determined with reference \\nto an appropriate comparator group of companies which \\nis reviewed annually. In this respect specific reference to \\nbase salary alignment is made to the Executive Directors’\\nRemuneration in the Techmark Companies Report. Factors\\ntaken into account for comparison purposes include company\\ntype and sector and measurement of company size by market\\ncapitalisation and turnover.\\nShort term incentives – performance bonus\\nThe Executive Directors are entitled to an annual discretionary\\nbonus under the Executive Directors’ Bonus Scheme. The\\nannual bonus is set at a percentage of base salary on a sliding\\nscale. Bonuses are earned on the achievement of gross margin\\nbased on forecast. For each 1% of gross margin achieved above\\n95% of forecast, the Executive Directors are entitled to receive\\na discretionary bonus equivalent to 3% of base salary, up to a\\nmaximum of 20% of base salary. The Remuneration Committee\\ndetermined not to award the Executive Directors with a bonus\\nunder this scheme during the year.\\nThe Chief Executive, under his service contract, is entitled \\nto an annual performance bonus of between 5 and 10% of \\nhis base salary, subject to his meeting and exceeding agreed\\nprofit targets for the business.\\nIn June 2004 the Committee determined that the Executive\\nDirectors should each receive a bonus following the acquisition\\nof Seravac Biotech (Proprietary) Limited recognising that the\\nExecutive Directors managed the execution of a large number \\nof complex transactions in a relatively short period of time and\\nshowed excellent negotiating skills.\\nShare incentive schemes\\nThe Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme.\\nExecutive Share Option Scheme\\nThe Executive Share Option Scheme was approved by\\nshareholders in June 1993. Under the scheme rules options\\ncan only be granted within a period of not more than 42 days\\nafter the date on which the annual or half yearly results of the\\nDirectors’ Remuneration Report ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 THERATASE PLC 19\\nCompany are announced. The aggregate maximum amount \\nof options which can be granted to an individual is limited to\\nfour times annual salary. The maximum number of options that\\ncan be granted in any 10 year period is limited to a number of\\nshares equal to 10% of the Ordinary issued share capital of \\nthe Company. Options may be exercised between the first and\\nseventh anniversary of the date of grant. The exercise price \\nof an option is not less than the mid market price of an\\nOrdinary share on the dealing day preceding the date of grant \\nof the options. No performance criteria are imposed for\\nexercising options.\\nThe scheme expired in June 2004, since under the rules of \\nthe scheme no option can be granted to an eligible employee \\nat any time after the 10th anniversary of the scheme. The last\\ngrant of option to Executive Directors under the scheme was\\nmade on 28 January 2002.\\nThe Committee has recently reviewed and taken advice on\\npossible replacement share incentive schemes. On the basis \\nof the Committee’s advice the Board is now proposing to \\nadopt the following new schemes:\\n• Theratase plc Long Term Incentive Plan;\\n• Theratase plc Savings Related Share Option Plan;\\n• Theratase plc International Savings Related Share \\nOption Plan;\\n• Theratase plc Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust. \\nThese schemes and the Trust will be put to shareholders for\\napproval at the 2005 Annual General Meeting and are\\ndescribed in more detail on pages 53 to 56.\\nBenefits\\nIn addition to their pension provisions described below, all\\nExecutive Directors are entitled to life assurance at three times\\nannual salary and private medical insurance. Executive Directors\\nand the Executive Chairman of Seravac are entitled to a\\ncompany car or a car allowance.\\nPension arrangements\\nThe Chief Executive has a personal pension plan to which the\\nCompany contributes 12% of base salary. Both the Finance \\nand Administration Directors are members of the Theratase plc\\nPension Scheme which is a defined contribution occupational\\npension scheme to which the Company contributes 12% of\\nbase salary. The Executive Chairman of Seravac has a personal\\nprovident fund scheme to which Seravac contributes 13.25% of\\nhis salary as part of his cost to the company.\\nPensionable earnings do not include elements of remuneration\\nother than salary.\\nDirectors’ service contracts\\nExecutive Directors each have a service contract of indefinite\\nduration until normal retirement age. It is the Company’s policy\\nthat Executive Directors’ service contracts should incorporate no\\nmore than one year’s notice of termination from the Company,\\nin line with current best practice. None of the Directors’ service\\ncontracts have a provision for compensation for loss of office or\\nwrongful termination upon change of control beyond payment in\\nlieu of contractual notice.\\nThe Committee’s policy for provision for compensation for \\nloss of office is to provide compensation which reflects the\\nCompany’s contractual obligations.\\nThe Committee allow the Executive Directors to accept\\nNon-Executive Director appointments with other companies.\\nAny appointment is subject to Board approval.

material in relation to \\nthe Group’s financial statements.\\nBasis of preparation\\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost accounting rules. The financial statements have also been\\nprepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.\\nBasis of consolidation\\nThe Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Theratase plc and all of its subsidiary undertakings together\\nwith the Group share of its joint venture under the gross equity method.\\nThe financial statements of all subsidiary undertakings are co-terminous with those of Theratase plc.\\nSubsidiary undertakings\\nThe acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. Under this method the results of the subsidiary undertakings acquired or\\ndisposed of in the year are included in the profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.\\nIn the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provisions for diminution \\nin value. Where the consideration for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings includes shares of the Company to which the merger\\nrelief provisions of Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 apply, cost represents the nominal value of such shares together with\\nthe fair value of any other consideration given and expenses incurred. On consolidation the difference between the nominal value \\nof the consideration shares and their fair value is taken to merger reserve.\\nIn accordance with Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 Theratase plc is exempt from the requirement to present its own\\nprofit and loss account. The retained profit for the year of Theratase plc is set out in note 20 to the financial statements.\\nGoodwill\\nGoodwill, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the\\nsubsidiary undertakings acquired is capitalised as an intangible asset in accordance with FRS 10 for acquisitions made after \\n1 October 1998, and written off on a straight line basis over its economic life, which is 20 years.\\nGoodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 October 1998 was written off directly against reserves on acquisition.\\nOn the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired subsidiary undertaking, the profit or loss on disposal or\\ntermination is calculated after charging the remaining balance of goodwill after amortisation, or in respect of subsidiary undertakings\\nacquired before 1 October 1998, the gross amount of the related goodwill previously written off directly against reserves.\\nTurnover\\nTurnover represents the amounts (excluding value added tax) net of discounts allowed derived from the provision of goods to \\nthird party customers during the year to the extent that all obligations relating to that turnover have been fulfilled in accordance \\nwith FRS 5.\\nFixed assets and depreciation\\nDepreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets by equal\\ninstalments over their estimated useful lives as follows:\\nFreehold buildings – 2%–4% per annum\\nPlant and machinery – 10%–33.3% per annum\\nMotor vehicles – 25% per annum\\nNo depreciation is provided on freehold land.\\nNotes\\nforming part of the financial statements 30 THERATASE PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004\\n1 Accounting policies (continued)\\nLeasing and hire purchase\\nWhere the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease \\nis treated as a “finance lease”. These assets, together with assets acquired under hire purchase arrangements, are recorded in \\nthe balance sheet as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Future instalments under such\\narrangements, net of finance charges, are included within creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element,\\nwhich is charged to the profit and loss account, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future\\ninstalments.\\nWhen the Group has leasehold property commitments and the Group is no longer using the property, the Directors have made\\nprovision for future commitments at the estimated discounted cost to the Group.\\nAll other leases are accounted for as “operating leases” and the rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line\\nbasis over the life of the lease.\\nDebt issue costs\\nIn accordance with FRS 4 the separately identifiable costs arising on the issue of debt instruments are capitalised and disclosed\\nwithin creditors as a deduction from the related debt. Issue costs are amortised over the life of the debt instruments they relate \\nto and the associated charge to the profit and loss account is included as an interest expense.\\nPension costs\\nThe Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. The amount charged against profits represents the contributions payable\\nto the scheme in respect of the accounting period. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.\\nF&H Baxter (Holdings) Limited and its subsidiaries operated a defined benefit scheme until the sale of the trade and assets of the\\ndivision in March 1996. The scheme has been discontinued and is in the process of being wound up. No contributions have been\\nmade since March 1996.\\nSeravac Biotech (Proprietary) Limited provides post employment medical aid benefits to seven retired former employees. Costs are\\nassessed using the projected unit credit method.\\nResearch and development expenditure\\nThe cost of fixed assets acquired to provide facilities for research and development activities is capitalised as tangible fixed assets\\nand depreciated over the expected useful economic life of the asset concerned. Research and development expenditure is written \\noff against profits in the year in which it is incurred.\\nGrants\\nRevenue based grants are credited to the profit and loss account so as to match them with the expenditure towards which they are\\nintended to contribute. Capital based grants are credited to the profit and loss account over the estimated useful economic lives of\\nthe assets to which they are related.\\nStocks\\nStocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. For work in progress and finished goods manufactured by the Group,\\ncost includes an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads.\\nTaxation\\nThe charge for taxation is based on the result for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences\\nbetween the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in\\nrespect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen \\nbut not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.\\nEmployee share schemes\\nThe cost of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares is recognised over the period to which the award\\nrelates. Provision is made for employer’s national insurance contributions which would become due on exercise of these options.\\nNotes continued ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 THERATASE PLC 31\\n1 Accounting policies (continued)\\nForeign currencies\\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies undertaken by the Group, including those of overseas subsidiaries where the trade of\\nthe subsidiary is more dependent on the economic environment of the investing company’s currency, are translated into sterling at\\nthe rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs, or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange\\ncontract.

This will replace the Company’s 1993 Executive\\nShare Option Scheme which has now expired and which did not\\ncontain performance targets. \\nThe design of the LTIP is intended to ensure that the interests \\nof senior executives and shareholders are brought more closely\\ninto line over the medium to long term and will incorporate\\nchallenging performance targets. The first awards will be granted\\nshortly after the AGM in March 2005, the target applying to the\\ninitial awards will be based upon comparing the growth in the\\nCompany’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) with the TSR of the\\ncompanies in the Techmark Mediscience Index over a three year \\nperformance period ending on 30 September 2007 and will\\nrequire the Company’s TSR to be in the median or better before\\nany awards vest. \\nSharesave plans\\nThe Remuneration Committee have decided to introduce a UK\\nsharesave plan which will be approved by the Inland Revenue\\nand will be open to all UK employees and an international\\nsharesave plan to enable all overseas employees to participate\\non similar terms. These plans replace a previous sharesave plan\\nwhich has now expired. \\nThe sharesave plans are designed to give all employees an\\ninterest in the performance of the Company. \\nEmployee Share Ownership Plan Trust\\nThe intention is to source sharesave options and LTIP awards\\nusing a combination of new issue and market purchase shares.\\nFor this reason it is proposed to introduce an Employee Share\\nOwnership Plan Trust (“ESOP”). The ESOP will operate in\\nconjunction with LTIP and Sharesave plans, it will be able \\nto buy shares in the market or subscribe for shares, subject \\nto certain limits, and transfer shares to participants to satisfy\\nsharesave options and LTIP awards. \\n1 Summary of the rules of the Theratase Long Term\\nIncentive Plan (the “LTIP”)\\nEligibility\\nAny employee (including an Executive Director) of a Group\\ncompany (other than a person who is within six months of his\\nanticipated retirement date) may be granted awards. \\nCircular to Shareholders\\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS IMPORTANT AND REQUIRES YOUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.

       "[' chief executive’s review\\n“An excellent performance\\nin the first six months of\\nthe year continued into\\nthe second half despite\\nincreasingly difficult market\\nconditions. Revenue has\\ngrown by 54% to £160.4\\nmillion and profit before tax\\nis up 31% to £17.7 million.”\\nAndrew Wiseman\\nChief Executive\\nThis has been achieved as a result of the\\nstrength of the Telford Homes brand,\\nincorporating realistic pricing and consistent\\ndelivery, together with strong marketing\\nconcepts which have allowed the Company to\\ncontinue selling homes to the investor market\\nat an early stage in the development process. \\nProperty sales and affordable housing\\nContracts were exchanged on 523 open\\nmarket private homes, 502 affordable\\nhomes and ten commercial units, making\\na total of 1,035 properties in the year.\\nIncluded within this number are 230 homes\\nbeing constructed under joint ventures\\nwhere we recognise half of the revenue\\nand profit from the development. \\nWhere the market allows we maintain\\nour policy of de-risking the business by\\ncontracting sales before much of the\\ndevelopment work on each site has taken\\nplace. This secures future cash flows and has\\nled to extended bank finance on a number\\nof developments where the volume of sales\\noffsets the risk of increased gearing. In total\\nwe had 2,051 properties under construction at\\n31st March 2008 of which 73% were secured\\nby contracts exchanged. \\nThe number of open market private homes\\nsold has increased by 9% this year with\\nthe average selling price of those homes\\nincreasing to £264,000 from £258,000.\\nSuccessful sales launches during the year\\ninclude the sale of all 161 open market\\nhomes at Merchants’ Quarter on the British\\nEstate, E3; Stadthaus, N1 where all 19 open\\nmarket homes were sold in November 2007;\\nVellum in Walthamstow where contracts\\nhave been exchanged on 24 of 66 open\\nmarket homes and Kinetica, E8 where 25 of\\n41 have been secured. Vellum and Kinetica\\nwere launched in the first few months of\\n2008 and reservations are still being taken\\nat these developments. Handovers of the\\ncompleted homes will take place in 2010,\\nby which time our investors anticipate that\\nthe market will have recovered.\\nIn contrast expected handover dates for the first\\nand second phases at Queen Mary’s Gate \\nin South Woodford are all during 2008. \\nThis development has been the Company’s\\n09     annual report and accounts 2008\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:54  Page 10 business & financial review\\nannual report and accounts 2008     10\\nQueen Mary’s Gate,\\nSouth Woodford, E18\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:54  Page 11 Icona, Stratford, E15\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:54  Page 12 business & financial review\\nmost significant sales outlet during the year\\nwith properties largely for the owner-occupier\\nmarket. The first phase is 93% sold with 172\\nout of 184 open market homes secured and\\nover 150 legally completed and occupied.\\nThe second phase is due to be completed\\nin November 2008 and contracts have been\\nexchanged on 18 of 93 open market\\nhomes with a further one reserved. \\nWhilst properties for the owner-occupier\\nmarket are less likely to sell at an early\\nstage, the rate of sale has significantly\\nslowed at Queen Mary’s Gate. Without\\nimprovement in the current market\\nconditions we expect to be carrying a\\nnumber of completed homes for sale\\non this development into 2009 and the\\nCompany is budgeting on this basis. \\nThe number of affordable homes sold has\\nincreased to 502 from 84 last year, partly\\nreflecting the timing of some significant\\ncontracts. Partnerships with affordable\\nhousing providers remain integral to\\nour business and typically 35% of any\\ndevelopment is sold for affordable housing. \\nThese partnerships are even more\\nsignificant in the current climate and\\nwe will continue to be active in seeking\\nopportunities where an increased level\\nof affordable housing reduces the open\\nmarket risk in a development. \\nOur development at Papermill Place in\\nWalthamstow incorporates 175 homes being\\nconstructed for East Thames Housing Group\\nfor £19.3 million as well as 66 open market\\nhomes being marketed as Vellum. This mix of\\nhomes improves the return on equity from\\nthe development and secures cash inflows\\nover the course of construction in return for\\na lower anticipated margin. In total at \\n31st March 2008 amounts due under\\naffordable housing contracts over the next\\nfew years were in excess of £60 million. \\nCompletions\\nConsumer confidence in the national\\nhousing market has been hit in recent\\nmonths by the reduced availability and\\nhigher cost of mortgage finance.\\nRestrictions on mortgage finance make\\nthe process of legally completing finished\\nproperties more protracted. \\nTelford Homes is communicating with\\neach purchaser to ensure their financial\\narrangements have been instigated at an\\nearly enough stage to meet our completion\\ndates. In addition we have been in dialogue\\nwith some of the major lenders and valuers\\nto maximise confidence through\\ntransparency of information. The \\nTelford Homes approach to sales is based \\non net prices agreed at the point of sale \\nwith no undisclosed discounts or incentives\\ndistorting true valuations. \\nIn the last six months we have legally\\ncompleted more than 300 open market\\nhomes at Icona in Stratford and \\nQueen Mary’s Gate with a quarter of these\\nin the past eight weeks. Although some have\\ntaken slightly longer than usual to complete\\nthere have only been a few serious issues; on\\ntwo occasions we rescinded contracts with\\nthe buyer and retained the 10% deposit. One\\nof these properties was immediately resold\\nand completed, the other was rescinded in\\nApril 2008 and is expected to be resold at no\\nless than the original purchase price. \\nDespite the problems in the mortgage\\nmarket, our performance on completions\\nto date coupled with our early dialogue\\nwith customers due to complete later in\\n2008 means that we remain confident that\\nthe projected cash inflows from exchanged\\nproperties will be realised. \\nannual report and accounts 2008     12\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:54  Page 13 Site acquisitions\\nThe Company has reduced its investment\\nin the development pipeline over the last\\nfew months in response to a climate of\\ncontinuing uncertainty in the housing\\nmarket and the economy. Protection of\\ncash has become our immediate priority\\nand we are therefore appraising sites\\nwhich have lower up-front net equity\\nrequirements including joint ventures and\\npartnerships with housing associations. \\nOur most recent acquisition is a parcel of\\nfive sites in Southwark in partnership with\\nFamily Mosaic Housing Association which\\nare expected to deliver over 100 new\\nhomes. There are no initial land payments\\nfrom Telford Homes and the expected\\nproceeds will be shared with Family Mosaic\\nunder the terms of the agreement. Three\\nof the sites are already under construction\\nand the other two are subject to receipt of\\nfull planning permission. \\nPlanning\\nThe planning process remains a significant\\nbarrier to the efficient delivery of new homes\\nin London. We retain a competitive advantage\\nthrough our knowledge of the local planning\\nenvironment in East London and this puts us\\nin a strong position. During the year we have\\nhad a number of successes including full\\nplanning permission for the 371 homes at\\nGreenwich Creekside, our joint venture with\\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland, and for 360\\nhomes in Bethnal Green Road, our joint\\nventure with Genesis Housing Group. \\nIncreasing bureaucracy and the need to satisfy\\nseveral different bodies with competing views\\nhave led to delays in the development of\\nsome sites which are expected to be under\\nconstruction during 2008. Two of our\\ndevelopments await appeal decisions which, if\\nallowed, will mean work can commence later\\nthis year. Overall the number of units in the\\ndevelopment pipeline that are subject to the\\nplanning process has reduced to 25% of the\\ntotal pipeline from 42% last year. \\nchief executive’s review\\n13     annual report and accounts 2008\\nCosmopolitan Apartments,\\nEnfield\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 14 business & financial review\\nDevelopment pipeline and partnerships\\nOur development pipeline, being properties\\nthat will produce profit in future years\\nexcluding those built for joint venture\\npartners, consists of 1,388 properties with\\nplanning permission and 454 subject to the\\nplanning process. This is a total of 1,842\\nproperties which are expected to provide\\nturnover in excess of £430 million and\\ngross profit of over £80 million. \\nAlthough we have reduced our investment\\nin new land, we have retained financial\\nresources to deploy in our partnerships\\nwith Eastend Homes and Poplar HARCA.\\nThese housing transfer organisations are\\nboth significant land owners in East\\nLondon and have chosen Telford Homes\\nto be their partner on a number of large\\nregeneration schemes. \\nFollowing the success of our partnership with\\nEastend Homes on the British Estate, E3, we\\nhave now submitted plans for the St George’s\\nEstate, E1 and we continue to progress master\\nplans for the regeneration of five other\\nestates. The British Estate has set the model\\nfor this partnership with land payments made\\nby Telford Homes being reinvested into the\\nthird party refurbishment of existing homes\\non the estate. In total the partnership with\\nEastend Homes is expected to add in excess of\\n1,000 properties to the development pipeline\\nand the partnership with Poplar HARCA is\\nexpected to add over 400 properties. \\nIn further recognition of our contribution\\nto the supply of affordable housing we\\nwere chosen as a pre-qualified partner\\nof the Housing Corporation during 2007.\\nThis enables the Company to bid directly for\\ngrant funding and gives us greater influence\\nin the provision of new affordable housing. \\nannual report and accounts 2008     14\\nComputer\\ngenerated image of\\nBethnal Green Road, E1\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 15 chief executive’s review\\n15     annual report and accounts 2008\\nOperating performance\\nThe operational output of the business\\ncontinues to grow and we have over 3,000\\nproperties either in the planning process, in\\ndetailed design or under construction. There\\nare now three operating divisions managing\\ndelivery, following the formation of Strada\\nearlier this year to join Alto and Metro. In\\nmany ways it is business as usual in the\\noperational management of the development\\npipeline and it will remain so if we continue\\nto be successful in selling our homes at an\\nearly stage in the development process. \\nHealth and Safety remains at the forefront\\nof our business and we have continued to\\ndevelop and monitor our policies and\\nprocedures during the year. \\nPeople\\nStaff numbers have risen in the last 12\\nmonths to manage increasing activity.\\nWe will maintain and expand this\\ninfrastructure to deliver our properties\\nwhilst we are able to secure the cash\\ninflows from their development. Every\\nemployee contributes to the excellent\\nreputation of Telford Homes and I thank\\neach of them for their efforts this year in\\nproducing another set of record results. \\nComputer generated\\nimage of Stadthaus, N1\\nTelford RA  24/6/08  17:55  Page 16 business & financial review\\nannual report and accounts 2008     16\\nComputer generated\\nimages of Kinetica, E8\\nCurrent trading and outlook\\nThe reduced availability of mortgage\\nfinance is continuing to weaken confidence\\nin the national housing market which makes\\nit more difficult to secure individual sales,\\neven in London, traditionally the most\\nresilient region. Our developments with\\ncompletion dates 12 months or more into\\nthe future continue to attract buyers’\\ninterest confirming long term confidence.\\nQueen Mary’s Gate, still with availability\\nand completing later in 2008, has seen a\\nsignificant slowdown in sales in the past\\nfew months due to short term concerns. \\nWe will time sales launches at Greenwich\\nCreekside and Bethnal Green Road to get\\nthe best results in light of prevailing market\\nconditions; both of these developments are\\ndue for completion in 2011. Reflecting our\\nhigh percentage of pre-sales at 31st March\\n2008 we have made only a handful of sales\\nsince the end of the year with no new\\nlaunches and relatively little marketing\\nactivity taking place during this period. \\nRecent figures from the Department for\\nCommunities and Local Government show\\nthat the supply of new homes is not going\\nto meet current government targets in the\\nshort term. New housing starts for the three\\nmonths to March 2008 were 32,100 against\\nan annual target of 240,000.

This means that instead of seeking to attract new Members through expensive advertising on \\ntelevision or in the national press, direct marketing, or price comparison sites, we instead benefit from \\ngenuine personal recommendations by both our Partners, and also by existing Members.\\nPartners can earn a small percentage of the monthly revenues generated by any Members gathered, either \\npersonally, or by someone in their team. On a similar basis, Members are directly rewarded with shopping \\nvouchers when they introduce a new Member, and receive additional vouchers annually in December \\nprovided the Member(s) they have introduced are still using our services. \\nWe continue to invest heavily in our bespoke IT systems; these enable us to integrate all the services we \\nsupply into a single monthly bill, supported by just one set of central overheads (including all administrative \\nand customer service functions). This highly efficient cost base is a key factor in enabling us to offer \\nattractive pricing and a wide range of valuable benefits to our Members, a secure residual income to our \\nPartners, and a growing dividend stream to shareholders.\\nOur business model requires us to provide exceptional customer service in order to convert our Members \\ninto fans, and ensure our Partners have the confidence to recommend us to their friends and family. We are \\nextremely pleased with the further progress we have made this year towards achieving these goals, and in \\nsecuring our position as the Nation’s most trusted utility provider.\\nSTRATEGY\\nOur strategy is to build on the current strong levels of organic growth we are achieving, in order to \\nprogressively increase our share of the markets in which we operate.\\n',\n",

Total\\nrevenue has grown by 10 per cent to £106.7 million\\nwith profit before tax and exceptional items up 12\\nper cent to £7.3 million.\\nThe Group reported in September 2008 that new\\naccounting standards had resulted in a change\\nto its accounting policies in relation to open\\nmarket private homes with revenue and profit\\nnow recognised on legal completion. On\\naffordable homes, sold to housing associations\\nunder construction contracts, revenue and profit \\nis recognised on a percentage of completion\\nbasis. There are currently over 700 affordable\\nhomes being developed and payments will\\ncontinue to be received from the Group’s\\nhousing association partners as construction \\nof these homes progresses.\\nSales\\nThe strategy of Telford Homes has always been\\nto pre-sell open market homes at a very early\\nstage of construction whenever possible. The\\nsuccess of this strategy in the past has meant\\nthat the Group has had relatively few properties\\navailable for sale over the past twelve months.\\nMarket conditions have affected the confidence\\nof purchasers of new homes and as such the\\nmarketing of unsold homes on developments\\ndue for completion in 2010 and 2011 has been\\nheld back while construction continues. With\\nsubstantial forward sales on these projects,\\nincluding the affordable housing, the Group’s\\ndecision to continue building has been taken\\nwith a recognition that lower open market sales\\nprices may be realised in the future.\\nEfforts to secure new sales have been\\nconcentrated at the Group’s developments \\nat Queen Mary’s Gate in South Woodford and\\nNayland Court in Romford. At Queen Mary’s Gate\\nthe first phase of the development, including 184\\nopen market homes, was completed in May 2008\\nand all but one have been sold and occupied\\nwith the final property now reserved. The second\\nphase, including 93 open market homes, was\\ncompleted in November 2008 and 29 have been\\nsold to date. The third phase including 95 open\\nmarket homes will not be build complete until the\\nsecond half of 2010. Overall sales at Queen Mary’s\\nGate have been considerably slower throughout\\nthe last twelve months although eight sales have\\ncompleted in the last twelve weeks with a further\\nfour reserved and one property where contracts\\nhave been exchanged. Visitor levels are now\\nmuch higher than at the end of 2008 and this \\ngives the Board an expectation that a slow but\\nsteady rate of sales will continue to be achieved\\nthrough the rest of this year.\\n07     Telford Homes Plc 2009\\nchief executive’s review\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 6 Telford Homes Plc 2009 08\\nbusiness & financial review\\nMetro East E3\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 7 09    Telford Homes Plc 2009\\nchief executive’s review continued\\nOneStratford E15\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 8 20,000\\n0\\n30,000\\n40,000\\n50,000\\n60,000\\n70,000\\n80,000\\nMar 09\\nFeb 09\\nJan 09\\nDec 08\\nNov 08\\nOct 08\\nSep 08\\nAug 08\\nJul 08\\nJun 08\\nMay 08\\nApr 08\\nMar 08\\nFeb 08\\nJan 08\\nSeasonally adjusted monthly number of mortgage approvals for house purchases by individuals\\nSource: Bank of England\\nAt Nayland Court in Romford, Telford Homes has\\n26 build complete homes remaining for sale with\\ndemand for these being maintained by the ‘My\\nChoice Home Buy’ scheme (“MCHB”) from the\\nHCA which provides a mortgage for up to 50\\nper cent of the home with a very low deposit\\nand interest rate. The processing of MCHB\\napplications suffers from periodic delays in the\\nrelease of funds but the Group has seven homes\\ncurrently reserved on the development all using\\nthis product. Here again, recent progress means\\nthe Group would expect to sell the majority of\\nthe remaining properties during 2009.\\nTelford Homes will bring other developments\\nback to the market when conditions are right\\nand when construction on those developments\\nreaches an appropriate stage to attract buyers.\\nCompletions\\nFrom 1st October 2008 Telford Homes began \\na rolling programme where 613 open market\\nhomes sold in previous years would become\\ndue for legal completion in the period up to\\nMarch 2010. As at 31st March 2009, 220 of \\nthese properties had been legally completed.\\nThe key issues for the Group’s customers are the\\nrestriction of mortgage finance for buy-to-let\\ninvestors and the increasing caution applied by\\nvaluation surveyors with a lack of comparable\\ntransactions. Importantly the Group’s properties\\ncontinue to attract tenants for its investor\\ncustomers and this underpins their value.\\nThe general problems experienced in securing\\nmortgages are illustrated by statistics for the\\nnumber of mortgage approvals for house\\npurchases in 2008. The Bank of England\\nseasonally adjusted figures show that the number\\nof approvals per month fell rapidly from 71,000 in\\nJanuary 2008 to 27,000 in November 2008. Since\\nthen there has been some improvement in these\\nstatistics with the number of approvals reaching\\n39,000 in March 2009. This is still well below normal\\nlevels and, whilst to date the process of achieving\\nnew sales and completions has not got any easier,\\nthe Board hopes it is an indication that mortgage\\navailability will improve during the rest of 2009.\\nTelford Homes continues pro-active\\ncommunication with each purchaser to ensure\\ntheir financial arrangements are instigated at\\nthe right stage and the Group has been\\nworking with each of them to maximise the\\nchances of achieving completions. In addition\\nTelford Homes has maintained a dialogue with\\nsome of the major lenders and their valuers to\\ngive maximum comfort in the pricing of the\\nGroup’s apartments through transparency of\\ninformation and supporting evidence. The\\nBoard has reported in the past that the Telford\\nHomes approach to sales is based on net prices\\nagreed at the point of sale with no undisclosed\\ndiscounts or incentives and this has proved\\nextremely important both to customers of\\nTelford Homes and their lenders.\\nThe Group will rescind contracts on properties\\nwhere its customers are unable to complete \\nthe purchase, retaining the 10 per cent deposit\\nalready paid. Where necessary, Telford Homes\\nwill also take legal action against the defaulting\\npurchasers as a result of their failure to honour\\ncontractual obligations.\\nTelford Homes Plc 2009 10\\nbusiness & financial review\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:02  Page 9 11     Telford Homes Plc 2009\\nDespite achievements to date the Group is\\nexperiencing significant delays in securing each\\ncompletion. As a result the Board has positioned\\nTelford Homes to withstand an increased number\\nof delays and failures. The total number of failures\\nin the year to March 2010 is forecast to reach\\nbetween 60 and 80 of the pre-sold homes due to\\ncomplete over that period, assuming there is no\\nimprovement in mortgage availability.\\nTelford Homes has contingency plans in place to\\ndeal with failed contracts which will mitigate the\\nimpact on cash flow. These plans include\\ntemporarily securing tenants for the properties\\nbefore reselling them into an orderly market. The\\nGroup has obtained outline terms from each of\\nits three banks to provide mortgages against a\\nportfolio of these rented properties at between\\n50 and 60 per cent of their value and in addition\\nthe Group is well advanced with contractual\\nnegotiations to secure £6 million of funding from\\nalternative sources at a 75 per cent loan to value\\nratio. This will enable the business to withstand\\nsignificantly more failures than anticipated as \\nwell as providing cash resources to further our\\npartnerships with housing associations and\\nhousing transfer organisations.\\nHCA and affordable housing\\nThe Board has taken a number of steps to\\nmaintain activity in the construction of new homes\\nthrough partnerships with housing associations and\\nthe HCA. As reported on 20th April 2009 the Group\\nhas agreed a grant programme with the HCA of\\n£57 million across four sites owned by Telford Homes\\nand three estate regeneration projects in\\npartnership with Eastend Homes. The grants will\\npart finance over 400 affordable homes over \\nthe next three years.\\nPartnerships with affordable housing providers\\nremain integral to the business and typically 35\\nper cent of any development is sold for\\naffordable housing. However in order to de-risk\\nnew projects the Group has sought to construct\\nsome developments entirely for its housing\\nassociation partners utilising HCA grant. Although\\nat a lower margin, this gives Telford Homes the\\nability to commence construction on these sites\\nwith secured cash inflows over the course of the\\ndevelopment. The Group has recently entered\\ninto a contract with Family Mosaic to construct 63\\naffordable homes across two sites in Queens\\nRoad, Southwark and a contract with Gallions\\nHousing Association to construct 53 affordable\\nhomes in St Anne’s Row, E14.

       " \" The Board is pleased to report that profit before tax for \\nthe year to 31 March 2011 is in line with expectations at \\n£3.0 million after exceptional items (2010: £7.3 million). \\nAlthough the number of open market properties \\ncompleted in the year is lower at 281 (2010: 389) the  \\nGroup has experienced strong demand for early sales \\nof its future developments, particularly from purchasers \\nin the Far East, such that the number of sales secured \\nby contracts exchanged in the year has increased to \\n368 (2010: 253). As a result of this and continued sales \\nof affordable housing to our housing association partners, \\nthe Group has revenue secured by contracts exchanged \\nof over £135 million to flow into the business over the  \\nnext three years.\\nSales and completions\\nTelford Homes is in the middle of a two year period \\nduring which the number of open market homes being \\nfinished is lower than capacity. The Group refrained from \\ninvesting in new land during the recession and, given the \\naverage construction period for a development is two \\nyears, this is affecting the number of homes available  \\nfor sale and legal completion up to the middle of 2012. \\nTherefore the decline in the number of open market \\ncompletions in the year to 31 March 2011 is caused more \\nby the reduced supply of finished homes than by market \\ndemand or the ability to make sales. Overall sales \\nperformance has been better than expected due to the \\nsuccessful off-plan marketing of developments that are \\ndue to be finished between mid-2012 and mid-2014.\\nProfit margins in the year to 31 March 2011 have been \\naffected by changes made during the recession to \\nfavour affordable housing and by impaired open market \\ndevelopments that were acquired by the Group in 2006 \\nand 2007. As expected this combination of reduced \\nsupply of finished open market homes and lower profit \\nmargins has brought total profits in the business down. \\nThe impact of both will continue into the year to \\n31\\xa0March 2012 such that the Board expects profit \\nbefore exceptional items to be similar year-on-year. \\nAlmost all of the developments that switched to \\naffordable housing and those impaired by prices falling \\nduring the recession will have worked through the \\ndevelopment pipeline by the end of the new financial year.\\nThe rate of sales of finished homes to UK buyers  \\nhas remained steady and visitor levels to the Group’s \\nsales centres have been consistent during the year. \\nConstruction of the third and final phase of Queen \\nMary’s Gate in Woodford finished towards the end  \\nof 2010 and we now have fewer than 60 homes left  \\nto sell out of nearly 500 across the development. In \\nSeptember 2010 the Group acquired The Royal Bank  \\nof Scotland’s 50 per cent interest in Telford Homes \\n(Creekside) Limited, the joint venture set up to develop \\nGreenwich Creekside. This development is undergoing  \\na period of phased handovers and over half of the  \\n121 open market homes in the first phase have now \\nbeen handed over to their purchasers.\\nThe availability of mortgage finance for new build \\nproperties remains the most significant restriction  \\non demand in the UK and this is particularly true for first  \\ntime buyers. Bank of England statistics show mortgage \\napprovals have been continuing at a steady rate, albeit at \\njust 40 per cent of the long term average. Whilst there \\nhave been some signs of improvement in the number \\nof mortgages available, the Council of Mortgage \\nLenders expects gross lending for housing to be \\nunchanged in 2011.\\nChief Executive’s \\nreview\\nAndrew Wiseman BA (Hons) FCMA\\nThe Group has revenue secured by \\ncontracts exchanged of over £135 \\nmillion to flow into the business \\nover the next three years\\n45% \\nincrease in open  \\nmarket sales\\n(contracts exchanged)\\nYear in Review\\nTEl FORd HOMES Plc  Annual Report & Accounts \\nfor the year ending 31 March 2011 10\\nTEF2681 - AR11 front AW02.indd   10 13/06/2011   10:48 AVANT-GARdE \\nShoreditch \\nE1\\nComputer Generated images of Avant-garde,  \\na development of 257 open market homes, \\n103 affordable homes and commercial space \\nnear Bishopsgate.\\nYear in Review\\n11\\nTEF2681 - AR11 front AW02.indd   11 13/06/2011   10:48 Chief Executive's review continued\\nAlongside a steady UK market, overseas launches \\nincluding Matchmakers Wharf, E9, the Hawksmoors, E1 \\nand, in April and May 2011, Avant-garde in Shoreditch \\nhave been very successful. Avant-garde is located just  \\na few minutes from Liverpool Street station and over \\n120 off-plan sales have been secured with buyers in \\nthe Far East, an unprecedented performance for this \\ntype of development. There has been equally strong \\noff-plan demand in the recovering London market \\nsuch that in total over 170 of the 257 open market \\nhomes have been sold in just two months of initial \\nmarketing. Construction is underway and handovers  \\nwill take place from late 2013 onwards.\\nThe majority of overseas sales are secured with a 20 \\nper cent deposit either all paid at contract exchange  \\nor paid in stages not later than one year before \\ncompletion. This provides the Group with equity to be \\nused for further site acquisitions and the repayment of \\ndebt. The Group will continue to market appropriate \\ndevelopments overseas to secure revenue that will  \\nbe recognised on legal completions in future years.\\nPartnerships and affordable housing\\nTelford Homes remains a grant partner of the  \\nHomes and Communities Agency (“HCA”) and has now \\ncompleted the first four developments under its 2008 \\nto 2011 grant agreement. The Group has received £55.1 \\nmillion out of a total grant allocation of £72.9 million and \\nthe vast majority of the remainder will be received \\nby March 2012 as affordable homes are completed in \\naccordance with their construction programmes.\\nThe Group has a secured revenue stream contracted for \\nthe affordable housing on all of its current developments \\nand is now developing a greater proportion of open \\nmarket housing such that it is not reliant on future, \\nuncertain, grant funding. New opportunities are \\nappraised on a conditional basis until the value and \\namount of affordable housing required is clear.\\nThe Spending Review has had a significant impact on \\nthe new four year affordable housing grant programme \\nfor 2011 to 2015. Central funding for new projects is \\nexpected to be around 25 per cent of the total grant \\nallocation for 2008 to 2011 and housing associations \\nhave been invited to close the funding gap by charging \\nhigher rents to new tenants under the new ‘affordable \\nrent’ model. This will only partially substitute for the \\nreduction in government funding and therefore less \\naffordable housing will be built. \\nThere remains a housing shortage in London and \\nTelford Homes will continue to work with both the HCA \\nand the local authorities to address the need for new \\nhousing developments to be brought forward and to \\nprovide affordable housing whilst ensuring that each \\nnew development remains financially viable.\\nl and acquisition\\nThe developments in the Group’s ownership during \\n2008 and 2009 were in good locations and were flexible \\nin terms of housing mix such that write downs were \\nless than three per cent of total assets and profitable \\ndevelopment could proceed with increased levels of \\naffordable housing. However the impact of not investing \\nin new sites during the recession, albeit a necessity at \\nthe time, is now being felt in terms of reduced output.\\nIn February 2010 Telford Homes raised £7.2 million  \\nof equity through a placing of new shares to bolster  \\nthe Group’s ability to purchase land. In addition to this \\nthe Board was delighted to sign a three and a half year \\n£70 million banking facility with The Royal Bank of \\nScotland, HSBC and Santander on 31 March 2011.  \\nThe process to secure this finance involved a year of \\nextensive investigation of every aspect of the business \\nand its financial position.

This was ahead of \\nthe Board’s expectations mainly due to strong \\nsales of finished homes in the last six months \\nof the year. For the last two years the Group has \\nbeen delivering a lower proportion of open market \\nhomes and has been achieving lower than normal \\nmargins due to the change in strategy required to \\nprotect the business during the downturn in the \\nhousing market.\\nThe Board targeted margin improvement during \\nthe year and gross and operating profit margins \\nare now moving in the right direction. The gross \\nmargin before interest charges and exceptional \\nitems has increased to 17.6 per cent (2011:  \\n15.1 per cent) and the operating margin before \\ninterest charges and exceptional items has \\nincreased to 6.2 per cent (2011: 5.2 per cent).  \\nAs a result of higher than expected sales and \\nmargin improvements, the Group has reported \\nprofit before tax and exceptional items up  \\n20 per cent at £3.0 million (2011: £2.5 million).\\nAll of the developments with a greater proportion \\nof affordable housing than usual, and the open \\nmarket homes achieving lower than expected \\nsales prices as a result of the last recession, \\nhave now been substantially completed. As such \\nit is anticipated that there will be an increased \\nnumber of open market completions in the new \\nfinancial year and that margins will return to more \\nnormal levels. In addition, of the open market \\nhomes expected to be handed over to customers \\nin the year to 31 March 2013 over 65 per cent \\nhave already been sold. The Board has previously \\nstated that it expects to report a substantial \\nincrease in pre-tax profits for the year to  \\n31 March 2013 and this remains the case.\\nl ondon housing market\\nThe London housing market has continued \\nto outperform the rest of the country and its \\nfundamental strengths, in terms of being a  \\nmajor international centre for finance and \\nbusiness with a growing population and a lack \\nof supply of new homes, suggest this is likely to \\ncontinue. Not only is the population growing but \\nprojections from the Office of National Statistics \\nindicate that 70 per cent of household growth in \\nthe next decade will be formed by single person \\nhouseholds. The Mayor’s London Plan predicts \\nthat more than 30,000 new homes are required \\nacross the capital each year for the next  \\n20 years. The number of new build starts \\nin London, recorded by the Department for \\nCommunities and Local Government, has been \\nconsistently below this and less than half of the \\nrequired number for the last four years.\\n“ The Board has previously stated  \\nthat it expects to report a substantial \\nincrease in pre-tax profits for the year \\nto 31 March 2013 and this remains \\nthe case.”\\nJon Di-Stefano, Chief Executive tel FORD h OmeS Plc  \\nAnnual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2012 12\\nReview of the Year\\nWhilst some commentators question these \\ndynamics of supply and demand it is clear that, \\nregardless of the inability of some purchasers to \\naccess mortgage finance, there is an increasing \\nrental demand that is not being satisfied. As a \\nresult, rents in some parts of London rose by \\nmore than 10 per cent in 2011.\\nOpen market sales\\nWhere possible the Group will sell open market \\nhomes early in the development cycle, typically \\nto investors. These investors are predominantly \\nbased overseas but there has also been demand \\nfrom UK buyers, all of whom are attracted by \\nrental yields of around six per cent.\\nIn April and May of 2011 the Group secured \\n186 sales at Avant-garde, E1 its joint venture \\ndevelopment with The William Pears Group.

Subsequently some \\nsmaller developments have secured sales in the \\nFar East followed more recently by the launch of \\nThe Panoramic in Poplar, E14 which took place \\nin Hong Kong and Singapore earlier this month. \\nThe Panoramic is a striking 20 storey tower in a \\nstrong location just to the north of Canary Wharf \\nand, as a result, 44 of the 90 open market homes \\nhave already been sold. Completions are due in \\nlate 2013. Selling nearly half of this development \\nat this stage is a great achievement given current \\neconomic concerns across Europe and confirms \\nthat London is still regarded as a safe haven for \\noverseas investment.\\nAlongside these successful overseas marketing \\ncampaigns a significant proportion of the  \\nGroup’s sales remain in the UK and particularly  \\nto owner-occupiers. Over 50 per cent of the  \\nopen market homes completed in the year to \\n31 March 2012 were sold to UK buyers. There \\nhave been strong sales recorded across all \\nof the Group’s developments during the year, \\nparticularly at Bow Trinity, E3, Greenwich \\nCreekside, SE8 and Matchmakers Wharf, E9 \\namongst others. All nine homes, including \\ndetached houses, at Wingfield Mews in Hendon \\nhave been sold and completed in the year and  \\nat High Cedars in Wanstead 15 out of 24 homes \\nare already sold three to four months ahead of \\nbuild completion. Additionally, there is now just \\none finished apartment left for sale at Queen \\nMary’s Gate in Woodford compared to 70 at  \\nthe start of the financial year.\\nTight mortgage availability restricts demand \\nfrom potential owner-occupiers and particularly \\nfirst time buyers. Although there was some \\nimprovement in the last year, mortgage lending \\nis still at very low levels and whilst this is \\nunlikely to get much better in the short term, \\nit seems equally unlikely that the situation will \\nget any worse. Lenders continue to discriminate \\nagainst new build properties by requiring higher \\ndeposits. The new Government backed 95 per \\ncent mortgage product ‘NewBuy’ should  \\nassist some purchasers but the Group will \\nmonitor the level of success the scheme enjoys  \\nbefore deciding whether to join at a later date. \\nChIeF exe CUt IVe’S ReVIeW 13\\nReview of the Year\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\nHIGH CEDARS\\nWANSTEAD\\nComputer Generated Images tel FORD h OmeS Plc  \\nAnnual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2012 14\\nReview of the Year\\nChIeF exe CUt IVe’S ReVIeW\\nTHE PANORAMIC\\nE14\\nComputer Generated Images 15\\nReview of the Year\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\nThe Board has ensured that the Group’s land \\nacquisitions have been in locations that appeal \\nto owner-occupiers with greater levels of equity \\navailable, sometimes sourced from extended \\nfamily, and investors that are seeking a return  \\non their equity and are funding their purchases  \\nat lower loan to value ratios.\\nPartnerships and affordable housing\\nDespite a return to constructing a more normal \\nproportion of open market homes, affordable \\nhousing remains a significant and important  \\npart of the business. In the year to 31 March 2012 \\nthe Group completed 542 affordable homes, \\nhanding them over to its various partners, and \\nas a result has received the vast majority of its \\n2008–2011 grant allocation from the Homes  \\nand Communities Agency (HCA). The HCA in \\nLondon has now become part of the Greater \\nLondon Authority (GLA) and the Group has \\nsecured a grant allocation in the new 2011–2015 \\nprogramme which will primarily assist the  \\ndelivery of estate regeneration schemes  \\nexpected to commence in the next few months.\\nThe funding regime for affordable housing \\nunderwent significant change in the last year  \\nand this led to uncertainty in modelling the \\nexpected value of affordable homes for all \\nconcerned. As the sector has got to grips with \\nthe new regime, the Group has developed a clear \\nunderstanding of the value of affordable homes \\nto be delivered at various rent levels, including \\nthe new ‘affordable rent’ model where rents are \\ncharged at a proportion of market levels.  \\nIn assessing these values, the Group has forged \\nnew relationships with some major housing \\nassociations keen to embrace the new funding \\nmodel. This is an important aspect of remaining \\ncompetitive in land acquisitions.\\nl and acquisition\\nDuring 2011 the Board reviewed its land \\nacquisition strategy and as a result made some \\nsmall changes to the Group’s area of operation. \\nThe focus of the Group’s land buying remains \\npredominantly in East London but is now \\nconcentrated on the areas in and around the City \\nand Canary Wharf where demand is stronger and \\nless reliant on mortgage constrained buyers. \\nThese areas are also benefitting from transport \\nimprovements as a result of the Olympics, the \\n£16 billion investment in Crossrail and new \\nfacilities such as the Westfield shopping centre  \\nin Stratford.\\nAs a result of reducing the scope for acquisition \\nin the outer boroughs of East London, the Board \\nhas widened its focus into adjoining areas of \\nNorth and Central London where higher priced \\nproperties are in demand both from investors and \\nowner-occupiers. The Group has purchased its \\nfirst development site in Lambeth, near the Albert \\nEmbankment, to provide 101 homes in a new  \\n24 storey tower and also acquired its first site  \\nin the London Borough of Camden.\\nIt is highly likely that this change in focus will \\nincrease the average price of the properties being \\ndeveloped by the Group in the next few years.  \\nIn the year to 31 March 2012 the average price  \\nof the open market homes sold was £339,000,  \\na significant increase on £259,000 last year.  tel FORD h OmeS Plc  \\nAnnual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2012 16\\nReview of the Year\\nChIeF exe CUt IVe’S ReVIeW\\nAVANT-GARDE\\nE1 17\\nReview of the Year\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\nHowever this was heavily influenced by the  \\nsales achieved at Avant-garde which has a  \\nmuch higher price point and excluding this \\ndevelopment the average price of the  \\nremaining sales was £266,000.\\nIn total Telford Homes has agreed to acquire \\nnearly £50 million of new land opportunities since \\nsecuring a long term bank facility in March 2011. \\nAll of these acquisitions have been purchased \\non the basis of an appropriate expected profit \\nmargin and return on capital. The majority have a \\nfull planning consent or are contracted subject to \\nachieving a satisfactory consent and all of them \\nare on ‘brownfield’ land. The Group has, and \\nwill, purchase smaller sites without a planning \\nconsent where the risk of not achieving a consent \\nis assessed to be very low. Despite excellent \\nrelationships within the Group’s area of operation \\nthe planning environment remains challenging \\nand, whilst any attempts to improve this are \\nwelcome, it remains to be seen what impact the \\nnew ‘National Planning Policy Framework’ will \\nhave.

We are also pleased with the early \\nperformance of Tesco Personal Finance under our ownership and \\nwith the converted Homever stores in South Korea. As a result,  \\nwe have delivered a solid sales and profit performance, both in  \\nthe UK and internationally, whilst continuing to invest in our long-\\nterm strategy for growth. We have made a good start to the new \\nfinancial year and I am confident Tesco will continue to make good \\nprogress even in the current global economic environment. \\nQ: It has been a very tough time for the economy but the good \\nnews is it has been very sturdy growth for Tesco. How have you \\nmanaged that?\\nA: it has been a very good year and mainly of course that is the dividend of \\nhaving a long-term, consistent strategy. We’ve invested into this slowdown \\nand that has given us good momentum through the recession. We are \\ngrowing fast in our overseas countries, laying out networks of stores \\nand we are still opening new space in the UK as well. in addition to that, \\nof course, people have to eat – we’re blessed in that sense, so we don’t \\nface the worst of the slowdown. We’ve also adjusted our business both in \\nthe UK and around the world to make sure that we offer better value \\nand better ranges which keeps customers in the stores, and helps \\nvolume in the business. \\nQ: You’re very much in the front line when it comes to knowing \\nwhat customers are thinking, how they are behaving. Are there \\nany signs that we have perhaps reached the bottom of the \\nrecession? What lies in store for the economy do you think?\\nA: it is very fluid at the moment – changes are happening over weeks,  \\nso i don’t think you can see any clear direction yet. What i would say is \\nthat it looks as if things are stabilising on the consumer front. in the UK \\nthe lower interest rates help, as do the lower fuel prices and energy  \\nprices, and coupled with the work that we have done in reducing food \\nprices for customers – this helps rebuild confidence. in c entral europe  \\nthe economies had a big decline early in the summer and the autumn  \\nof 2008 – that feels as if it has levelled out, which is encouraging. in asia  \\nit is too early to say. t heir decline came later with the destocking of the \\nsupply chain and so for them it really hit around December. t hese are \\nstrong economies and the destocking will end and we’ll start to get  \\nrestocking in the pipeline which will help. \\nQ: Priorities change during a recession – for business and \\ncustomers alike. Is there a risk that the focus on green and \\ncorporate responsibility slips somewhat?\\nA: it is important that it doesn’t and it’s one of the reasons we lay  \\nsuch emphasis within t esco on our ‘s teering Wheel’ – our balanced \\nscorecard – so that whatever is going on in the outside world, we  \\nkeep focused on the things that matter long term. o f course price  \\nand trading is important at the moment, but there are big long-term \\nobjectives around community and the environment that we have got  \\nto stay committed to. t esco has to help customers change from mass \\nconsumption to green consumption. o n climate change, we’ve got to \\nlearn how to run this business on 80% less carbon. We have got great \\nplans and we are making great progress. o f course it helps the business \\ntoo – not wasting things is a very good habit at a time like this and one \\nof the reasons our energy bills are down £100 million this year is because \\nof all of the green initiatives we’ve been working on over several years. \\nQ: Bearing in mind what you have seen in the US so far, are you \\npleased with the progress? \\nA: i am, yes, because there’s lots to be pleased about. c learly nobody  \\nwould have chosen to open into the scale of recession that we’ve seen \\nthere, which is particularly stiff in the Western United states, but the \\ncustomers love the stores and they appeal right across the income range \\nand the age range, and that bodes very well for their long-term appeal. \\nFresh & easy is more than just a niche retailer – it’s a new and different \\nform of retailing. c ustomers obviously like the fresh foods and they  \\nlike the own-brand products, but also are increasingly recognising the \\ntremendous prices that are on offer and of course that is very important \\nat the moment. t he operation is very good and it’s strong. We really \\nhave created the business that we set out to create in terms of the \\nhighest, freshest quality in the market at the best prices in the local \\nneighbourhood. We are expanding the business at a good rate and \\nmorale is high. \\nQ: What excites you most about the year ahead?\\nA: First of all we’re growing – and we’re serving more customers. t hey \\nhave needs; they are just different needs at a time like this. it’s what \\nt esco is for – to stay close to customers and change as their needs \\nchange. t hat’s got to take a different form in different categories or in \\ndifferent parts of the world. it’s important you have strong, confident \\nlocal leadership teams who take the responsibility to make those \\nchanges. i believe that is happening. if you look at our businesses – \\nwhether it’s non-food, financial services or in our international markets \\n– we are growing strongly and we are growing market share. t here’s \\nmore that we have to do from place to place, but confidence is high. \\npeople know what they have to do and have the authority to do it. \\nAt a time when customers everywhere are \\nfeeling the economic strain, we are responding  \\nto their changing needs in all our markets by \\nlowering prices, introducing more affordable \\nproducts and offering even sharper promotions.\\nSir Terry Leahy, Chief Executive\\nTo see a full video interview go to\\nwww.tesco.com/annualreport09/presentations\\n',\n",

       "[\" At 31st March 2008 unrecognised\\nrevenue secured by contracts exchanged was\\n£125 million, higher than ever before. Our\\nstrategy has put us in a very strong position\\nin the face of a weakening market. This prudent approach will\\ncontinue. We expect trading conditions to improve\\nwhen restrictions ease in the mortgage\\nmarket although it is not clear when this will\\noccur. Vellum and Kinetica\\nwere launched in the first few months of\\n2008 and reservations are still being taken\\nat these developments. Partnerships with affordable\\nhousing providers remain integral to\\nour business and typically 35% of any\\ndevelopment is sold for affordable housing. Restrictions on mortgage finance make\\nthe process of legally completing finished\\nproperties more protracted. Our most recent acquisition is a parcel of\\nfive sites in Southwark in partnership with\\nFamily Mosaic Housing Association which\\nare expected to deliver over 100 new\\nhomes. Three\\nof the sites are already under construction\\nand the other two are subject to receipt of\\nfull planning permission. Planning\\nThe planning process remains a significant\\nbarrier to the efficient delivery of new homes\\nin London. This is a total of 1,842\\nproperties which are expected to provide\\nturnover in excess of £430 million and\\ngross profit of over £80 million. In total the partnership with\\nEastend Homes is expected to add in excess of\\n1,000 properties to the development pipeline\\nand the partnership with Poplar HARCA is\\nexpected to add over 400 properties. In further recognition of our contribution\\nto the supply of affordable housing we\\nwere chosen as a pre-qualified partner\\nof the Housing Corporation during 2007. This enables the Company to bid directly for\\ngrant funding and gives us greater influence\\nin the provision of new affordable housing. Health and Safety remains at the forefront\\nof our business and we have continued to\\ndevelop and monitor our policies and\\nprocedures during the year. People\\nStaff numbers have risen in the last 12\\nmonths to manage increasing activity. We will maintain and expand this\\ninfrastructure to deliver our properties\\nwhilst we are able to secure the cash\\ninflows from their development. New housing starts for the three\\nmonths to March 2008 were 32,100 against\\nan annual target of 240,000. Ongoing tighter\\nterms for mortgage finance will further\\nrestrict new starts as developers will not\\nconstruct properties that cannot be sold. Operating results\\nRevenue increased to £160.4 million from\\n£104.4 million last year. An analysis of\\nproperties sold in the year is given in the\\nChief Executive’s review. Our commercial\\nteams are focused on achieving cost savings\\nin the coming months. Total build costs in\\nthe year to 31st March 2008 were \\n£76 million up from £50 million last year. The operating margin has fallen to 15.8%\\nfrom 16.0% with overheads reducing as a\\npercentage of revenue to 5.1% from 6.4%\\nlast year. Interest\\nInterest charged in the year was £8.1 million,\\nup from £4.0 million last year in line with\\nour expectations. Pressure on finance costs has\\nbeen alleviated to some extent by the\\nrecent reductions in the base rate. The Company has\\nrecently negotiated a £33 million\\ndevelopment facility with The Royal Bank\\nof Scotland for Greenwich Creekside at\\nbase rate plus 1.5% and these rates are\\nstill being achieved thanks to our strong\\nrelationships and proven track record in\\nachieving sales. In this context we have\\nnegotiated base rate plus usual margins\\nplus an additional 0.5% while three month\\nLIBOR remains more than 0.5% over base\\nrate. Essentially this caps the additional\\nLIBOR liability at 0.5% whilst the current\\ndifferential is nearer to 0.9%. Interest cover was 3.6 times in 2008 which\\nremains well within acceptable limits. Dividends\\nThe board proposes a final dividend of 5.5\\npence per ordinary share. The total\\ndividend last year was 8.9 pence. The final dividend is expected to be paid\\non 18th July 2008 to shareholders on the\\nregister on 27th June 2008. Typically the debt to equity ratio\\nin these facilities is 70/30 with extended\\nfunding available on some sites where all\\nproperties have been sold. We maintain excellent relationships with\\neach of our banking partners and fully\\ninvolve them in our cash flow forecasting and\\nsensitivity analysis. Our revolving loan facility with Allied Irish\\nBank of £40 million is allocated to certain\\ndevelopment sites. At 31st March 2008 we\\nhad utilised £24.8 million of this facility\\nleaving an unutilised balance of \\n£15.2 million. The facility is next due for \\nan annual review in April 2009. Interest is charged at LIBOR plus 1.25%. The Company has site specific loan\\nfacilities with The Royal Bank of Scotland\\nof £84.3 million. At 31st March 2008 we\\nhad utilised £51.6 million of these\\nfacilities leaving an unutilised balance of\\n£32.7 million. Facilities are repayable on\\ncompletion of each development directly\\nfrom the sales proceeds received. The Company has recorded\\nits 50% share of the loan in its balance\\nsheet at 31st March 2008. This facility is\\ndue for repayment in 2011. The Company has site specific loan facilities\\nwith Barclays Bank of £12.6 million. At 31st\\nMarch 2008 we had utilised £5.4 million of\\nthese facilities leaving an unutilised balance\\nof £7.2 million. These facilities are due for\\nrepayment during 2010. Gearing is down from 173% reported\\nfor the interim results as we have reduced\\ninvestment in the development pipeline. We remain comfortable with our level of\\ngearing as we can balance the certainty of\\nfuture cash inflows against exposure to debt. The\\nboard has determined that levels of\\nuncovered gearing up to 100% are\\nacceptable. Facilities are managed to minimise\\nthe drawdown of funds where these are not\\nimmediately required in the business in\\norder to control interest costs. At 31st March 2008 the Company had\\nunutilised overdraft facilities of £3 million\\n(2007 - £2.5 million). Cash flow\\nWe maintain a detailed month by month cash\\nflow forecast as part of our management\\ninformation systems. This extends five years\\ninto the future and is subject to continual re-\\nassessment and sensitivity analysis. There were no\\nsignificant changes in accounting required\\nas a result of the Company adopting IFRS. Telford Homes has developed in\\nnine East London boroughs in the\\npast and in 2008 is developing in\\nSouthwark for the first time,\\ncommencing design and construction\\non five sites in partnership with\\nFamily Mosaic Housing Association. The regeneration of East London\\nwill continue for many years to\\ncome and, while the opportunities\\nto utilise the Company’s competitive\\nadvantage remain, Telford Homes\\nwill continue to play a significant\\nrole in this process. Image courtesy of www.gettyimages.com. Each division specialises in\\ncertain sizes of development and styles of\\nconstruction. Alto are responsible for over\\n1,700 of the properties in planning, design\\nand construction across eight developments,\\nMetro are responsible for over 600 properties\\nacross 18 developments and Strada over 700\\nproperties across four developments. Together they have responsibility on the\\nboard for the management of the three\\noperating divisions. Mark Parker is\\nresponsible for Metro and Strada and John\\nFitzgerald is responsible for Alto. All of these are outside of the Company’s control. This land needs to be sourced in appropriate locations and where optimum\\nplanning consents can be obtained. In particular our existing partnerships with housing transfer organisations are\\nexpected to be a significant source of land in the next few years. Health and Safety\\nConstruction sites are dangerous places and there are many different health and safety risks to consider. The Company has extensive knowledge of local planning requirements, excellent relationships with\\nplanning authorities and takes care in the appointment of professional architects, planning consultants\\nand engineers. Early consultations with the planning authorities are a key part of the land acquisition\\nprocess. While this cannot remove planning risks it mitigates them as much as possible. The Company has\\n454 properties in the development pipeline going through the planning process reduced from 942 last year. Standards of construction and control of the building process on site are of paramount importance to each\\noperating division. The construction teams work very\\nclosely with the Customer Service team and their interaction commences at an early stage in the development. Availability of materials and labour\\nThe availability of materials and sub-contracted labour for each site can affect both the construction\\nprogramme and the cost of construction. Build cost inflation will impact directly on the margin achieved\\non each site where this is in excess of forecasts. The\\ntender process ensures that competitive rates are achieved on every trade. Political environment\\nChanges in laws and regulations can have a direct impact on the efficient running of the Company\\nand the costs incurred on each development. Changes in both local and national government can\\nhave a direct bearing on the regulatory environment. Forecasting of cash flows is\\ncritical to ensure the Company is not operating above its financial capacity. The Company maintains a detailed cash flow forecast as part of its management information systems. This\\nextends five years into the future and is subject to continual re-assessment and sensitivity analysis. The Company has excellent relationships with the three banks currently funding the business and has sufficient\\nfacilities available to ensure the continuing operation of the business on all sites currently under construction. We continue to invest in the training\\nand development of our people with the\\nintroduction of our ‘Health and Safety Core’\\ntraining programme. This training programme\\nensures that the same level of training is\\ndelivered across the Company including those\\njoining the business. We continue to explore new and different\\nways of working to improve our efficiency\\nand reduce our exposure to risk. A good\\nexample of this is our Stadthaus development\\nin Murray Grove, N1 where the tallest timber\\nstructure in Europe is being constructed. Traditionally the height of our developments\\nhas precluded this type of structure but recent\\ndevelopments within the industry have made\\nit possible. The modular construction process\\nnot only increases the efficiency of the build\\nbut crucially dramatically reduces the\\nexposure to risk for those involved in\\nthe construction process. Our ‘supply-chain’ procedure continues\\nto be developed with the majority of our\\nsuppliers now vetted by our health and\\nsafety department. A procedure is in place\\nprohibiting the placing of orders with suppliers\\nthat have not been successfully audited. John Fitzgerald, Mark Parker and \\nMark Duffield are responsible for health\\nand safety in each of the operating divisions\\nwith the assistance of Steve Nicoll. John Fitzgerald is the board member with\\noverall responsibility for health and safety. The Company has an\\nenvironmental policy and we ensure that this\\nis communicated throughout our operations. Our most recent schemes aim for a\\nminimum of 10% of energy to come from\\nsustainable sources. A number of ‘green’\\nand ‘brown’ roofs across our developments\\nprotect the natural habitat of birds such as\\nthe Black Redstart. These are just a few of the things that\\nTelford Homes is doing and all of these\\ninitiatives are having a positive impact now\\nand will continue to do so in the future. The regeneration of East London is an\\nongoing project in which we are playing\\na major role. We have\\nexcellent relationships with local councils and\\nhousing associations and we are extremely\\nsupportive of the need to provide affordable\\nhousing for shared ownership and for rent. This dedicated\\nteam is both approachable and friendly and\\nprovides a professional service at all times. Telford Homes have\\na dedicated in-house maintenance team\\nthat are quick to respond and deal with\\nany issues as and when they are reported. All calls and scheduled appointments are\\ndirected through a highly efficient head\\noffice based service team.

These policies are monitored to ensure that they are\\nappropriate to the Company’s circumstances and comply as far as possible with the provisions of the Code given\\nthe size of the Company. Directors\\nThe Company is managed by a board of directors and they have the necessary skills and experience to effectively\\noperate and control the business. There are nine directors in total of whom two are non-executive directors. The board meets once a month and the directors make every effort to\\nattend all board meetings. The board is responsible for taking all major strategic decisions and also addressing any significant operational\\nmatters. Management information systems are in place to enable the directors to make\\ninformed decisions to properly discharge their duties. The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separate. The Chairman is responsible for running the board\\nand he meets regularly and separately with the Chief Executive and the other non-executive director to discuss\\nmatters for the board. One third of the directors retire annually in\\nrotation in accordance with the Company’s articles of association. This enables the shareholders to decide on the\\nelection of their Company’s board. The directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements as set\\nout in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. The responsibilities of the auditors are set out in their report. The non-executive directors\\nmeet separately with the auditors once a year. The committee has a responsibility for reviewing the financial statements provided to shareholders. Relations with shareholders\\nThe Company has institutional shareholders and is, where practicable, willing to enter into a dialogue with them. The\\nChief Executive and the Financial Director meet regularly with institutional investors within the confines of relevant\\nlegislation and guidance. All board members present at the AGM are available to answer questions from\\nshareholders. Internal control\\nThe board is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The board formally monitors\\nmonthly progress on each development. Going concern\\nThe directors consider that the funds available to the Company are sufficient for its operation for the\\nforeseeable future. Composition of the remuneration committee\\nThe remuneration committee comprises the independent non-executive directors, David Holland and \\nRobert Clarke. The committee makes recommendations to the board on executive directors’ service agreements\\nand remuneration. In doing so it has undertaken relevant research to ensure that remuneration levels are\\ncompetitive with the industry average. The committee met twice during the year. Both schemes are dependent on the Company\\nmeeting certain financial performance targets. The maximum amount that can be earned under the executive\\nbonus scheme is 100% of basic salary. Further details are given in note 17 to the financial statements. The remuneration committee is\\nresponsible for approving any offers of shares made under the DPSPP. The board as a whole determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors after considering external market\\nresearch. They do not participate in the bonus schemes or in the group personal pension scheme. They are entitled to\\nparticipate in the SIP. Service contracts\\nThe executive directors have service contracts that can be terminated on 12 months notice. These provide for\\ntermination payments equivalent to 12 months basic salary and contractual benefits. The non-executive directors have letters of appointment that can be terminated on three months notice. The primary key performance indicators are disclosed on page 3. John Fitzgerald and Mark Parker were appointed to the board on the 1st August 2007. Both retire at the next\\nAnnual General Meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. All shares purchased under the SIP are matched by shares\\nprovided by the Company on a one for one basis. Further details\\non the SIP are included in note 17 to the financial statements. Investment in own shares\\nThe Company’s investment in own shares relates solely to employee share schemes and further details of the total\\nholding and movements in the holding are disclosed in note 17. Creditors\\nIt is Company policy to settle all debts with its creditors on a timely basis. Subcontractors are paid upon agreement\\nof the value of works completed based on their applications for payment and the terms agreed. In general, other\\nsuppliers are paid during the month following the month of receipt of the invoice unless other terms have been\\nspecifically agreed. At 31st March 2008 trade creditors represented 14 days purchases (2007 – 12 days). Employees\\nThe Company places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and keeps them informed of all\\nrelevant matters on a regular basis. These donations were made to a number of\\ndifferent charities supporting a broad range of good causes. Auditors\\nA resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the Company will be proposed at the \\nAnnual General Meeting in accordance with section 385 of the Companies Act 1985. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements. The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any\\ntime the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with\\nthe Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for\\ntaking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the\\nUnited Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation\\nin other jurisdictions. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory\\nrequirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also report to\\nyou whether in our opinion the information given in the report of the directors is consistent with the financial\\nstatements. We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited\\nfinancial statements. We consider the implications for our\\nreport if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and\\ndisclosures in the financial statements. In forming our opinion\\nwe also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements. These are the Company's first financial statements\\nprepared under IFRS and IFRS 1 has been applied. An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected\\nthe reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company is provided in note 21. The Company has a dormant subsidiary and has elected to apply the Companies Act 1985 exemption from\\npreparing consolidated financial statements on the basis that the subsidiary is immaterial. Accounting convention\\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with\\napplicable International Accounting Standards. All revenue is generated in the United Kingdom. Profit on developments is recognised over the life of each development in proportion to revenue only to\\nthe extent that the total eventual profit on the development can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Until there is reasonable certainty over the final outcome of a development the profit is restricted to the\\nnon-refundable deposits received. Losses are provided for as soon as foreseen. Commission received on property sales made on behalf of third parties is recorded within revenue, with all\\ncosts associated with the sale of those properties recognised within cost of sales. Finance leases and hire purchase contracts\\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks\\nand rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. The corresponding\\nliability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease or hire purchase obligation. Finance charges are charged to the income statement. Property, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. These are held for future sale. Financial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company's balance sheet when the Company\\nbecomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument. Borrowings\\nInterest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. Interest payable on\\nbank loans and overdrafts is written off to the income statement using the effective interest method. Trade payables\\nTrade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. Fair value is\\ndetermined by using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities and equity instruments\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual\\narrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the\\nassets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are\\nrecorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Taxation\\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on the profits for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported\\nin the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are tax deductible in other years\\nand it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is\\ncalculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at\\nthe balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the\\nfuture or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or\\ncredited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. With respect to share-based payments, a deferred tax asset is recognised on the relevant tax base. The tax base is then compared to the cumulative share-based payment expense recognised in the income\\nstatement. Profit on developments is\\nrecognised in proportion to revenue only to the extent that the total eventual profit on the development\\ncan be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Recognition of profit also involves estimation of the total expected revenue\\nfrom each development and therefore the expected profit margin that will be achieved. Judgement is required\\nto assess whether the total eventual profit on each development can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Carrying value of land and work in progress\\nInventories include land and work in progress in respect of development sites. In some cases land is held\\nawaiting a planning consent. The Company has not early adopted any\\nstandards, amendments or interpretations. The option of immediately expensing borrowing costs is removed. The amendment will apply to the\\nCompany from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009. IAS 1 (Amendment) 'Presentation of Financial Statements'. This amendment prohibits the presentation of items\\nof income and expense (that is 'non-owner changes in equity') in the statement of changes in equity. Revised\\nIAS 1 also sets out the additional disclosure requirements for entities making restatements or reclassifications. The amendment will apply to the Company from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009. IFRS 2 (Amendment) 'Share-based payments'. This amendment clarifies that vesting conditions are service\\nand performance conditions only. It also specifies that all cancellations should receive the same accounting\\ntreatment, whether cancelled by the entity or by other parties. The amendment will apply to the\\nCompany from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009. This standard includes some significant changes to how the acquisition method is applied\\nto business combinations. The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions\\nwith non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control. At 31st March 2008 payments\\nof £47,000 were due to the scheme (2007 - £32,000). Their employment costs have been included for the full year ended \\n31st March 2008 and the year ended 31st March 2007. This was substantially enacted on the 26th June 2007. Deferred tax is calculated\\nusing a 28% rate. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in\\nissue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Island Gardens Limited is a dormant company with share capital of £2. At 31st March 2008 the Company held 50% of the issued share capital of Telford Homes (Creekside)\\nLimited, a company registered in Scotland, which has been incorporated to assist the Company in carrying\\nout a joint property development. At 31st March 2008 the Company held 50% of the issued share capital of Bishopsgate Apartments LLP, a\\nlimited liability partnership registered in England, which has been incorporated to assist the Company in\\ncarrying out a joint property development. The operating cycle is such that a proportion of\\ninventories will not be realised within twelve months. On 11th June 2007, 125,430 ordinary shares were issued at 143.5p as a result of share options being exercised. Details of own shares held within employee benefit trusts are disclosed in note 17. All shares rank equally in respect of shareholder rights. Awards under each scheme are made periodically to new employees. All schemes are equity-settled and\\noptions can normally be exercised three years after the grant date. This charge is calculated at the date of grant of the\\noptions and is charged equally over the vesting period. The corresponding adjustment to equity is made\\ndirectly to the profit and loss reserve. The Company has used the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to calculate the fair value of outstanding\\noptions. Individual calculations have been performed for groups of share options with differing exercise\\nprices and dates. Volatility\\nin more recent years is considered to have more relevance than earlier years for the period reviewed. At 31st March 2008 outstanding options granted over 10p ordinary shares were as follows:\\nShare option scheme Option price Number Dates exercisable\\nCompany approved 143.5p 20,905 5 Aug 2007 to 5 Aug 2014\\n144.5p 83,044 6 Jan 2008 to 6 Jan 2015\\n138.5p 108,300 17 May 2008 to 17 May 2015\\n153.5p 234,516 10 Nov 2008 to 10 Nov 2015\\n167p 71,856 27 Feb 2009 to 27 Feb 2016\\n205p 87,804 15 June 2009 to 15 June 2016\\n213.5p 1,110,029 14 Feb 2011 to 14 Feb 2018\\nCompany unapproved 60.5p 50,414 5 Mar 2005 to 5 Mar 2012\\n75p 220,000 1 Oct 2005 to 1 Oct 2012\\n74.5p 59,732 20 Feb 2006 to 20 Feb 2013\\n138.5p 50,542 17 May 2008 to 17 May 2015\\n167p 50,000 27 Feb 2009 to 27 Feb 2016\\nTelford Homes Plc Share Incentive Plan\\nDuring the year ended 31st March 2004 Telford Homes Plc set up a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) for the\\nbenefit of all of the employees of the Company. This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and\\nconfers certain tax advantages for participating employees. The SIP provides for employees to purchase shares up to a value of £1,500 in each tax year. These shares\\nare known as 'Partnership shares'. Dividends are paid on both Partnership and Matching shares and these are allocated to\\nemployees as 'Dividend shares'. The Company has set up a trust to administer the SIP and to hold shares on behalf of individual\\nemployees. The costs associated with the trust are paid for by the Company and the\\nCompany finances all share purchases. The trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating in the\\nscheme. These shares remain in the trust until such time as an employee withdraws from the SIP . Further shares\\nhave been allocated to employees as Matching shares and the cost of these shares is being written off over the\\nthree year holding period. Shares held by the SIP are recognised as a deduction from shareholders’ funds. Movements in the profit and loss reserve relating to\\nthe SIP are shown in the statement of changes in equity. This loan is interest free and repayable on or before\\nthe repayment date which is normally ten years from the date of the loan or on leaving employment or\\ndisposing of the shares. The loan has limited recourse such that repayment is limited to the value of the\\nshares on the repayment date. The Company will lend the trustee sufficient funds to enable the trustee to\\nprovide the loans to individual participants. Offers to participants\\nwill be made periodically at the discretion of the directors of Telford Homes Plc. These shares were issued on 9th November 2006. On this date the Company\\nprovided a loan to the trustee of £1,430,000 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the\\nparticipants. These shares were issued on 14th December 2007. On this date the Company\\nprovided a loan to the trustee of £390,400 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the\\nparticipants. At 31st March 2008 £13.9 million\\n(2007 - £10.0 million) had been paid for the site and a further liability of £7.3 million (2007 - £1.4 million)\\nhas been accrued. 19 Related party transactions\\nThe Board and certain members of senior management are related parties within the definition of IAS 24\\n(Related Party Disclosures). In July 2006 David Holland purchased an apartment from the Company at the OneStratford development. Subsequently contracts were exchanged on 11th December 2006 for a parking space at the same\\ndevelopment. The combined purchase price was £262,500. The Company has received deposits to the value\\nof £26,250 with the balance due on legal completion which is scheduled for 2009. The purchase was\\napproved at a previous Extraordinary General Meeting. All other trade and other receivables \\nand trade payables are due within one year. All land creditors are due within one year. At 31st March 2008 the Company had unutilised overdraft facilities of £3.0 million (2007 - £2.5 million). The Company has a revolving loan facility with Allied Irish Bank of £40.0 million in respect of certain\\ndevelopment sites. Interest is charged at base rate plus a margin which varies between 1.5% and 2.25%\\ndepending on the nature of individual sites and the relationship between base rate and LIBOR. This facility is due for review in April 2009. Interest is charged at LIBOR plus 1.25%. At 31st March 2008 Bishopsgate Apartments LLP had utilised \\n£19.0 million of this facility leaving an unutilised balance of £1.0 million. The Company has recorded its\\n50% share of the loan in its balance sheet at 31st March 2008. The Company has site specific loan facilities with The Royal Bank of Scotland of £84.3 million. At 31st March 2008 the Company had utilised £51.6 million of these facilities leaving an\\nunutilised balance of £32.7 million. Facilities are repayable on the completion of each development\\ndirectly from the sales proceeds received. Of the utilised loans of £51.6 million a total of £28.5 million is\\ndue for repayment within one year, £21.8 million is due for repayment after more than one year and less\\nthan two years and £1.3 million is due for repayment after more than two years and less than five years. Interest is charged at base plus 1.25% on the land facility and base plus 1.5%\\non the construction facility. At 31st March 2008 Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited had utilised \\n£13.8 million of this facility leaving an unutilised balance of £37.5 million. The Company has recorded its\\n50% share of the loan in its balance sheet at 31st March 2008. This facility is due for repayment in 2011. The Company has\\nrecorded its 50% share of the bill of exchange in its balance sheet at 31st March 2008. The Company has site specific loan facilities with Barclays Bank of £12.6 million. Interest is charged at base\\nrate plus 1.5%. At 31st March 2008 the Company had utilised £5.4 million of these facilities leaving an\\nunutilised balance of £7.2 million. These facilities are due for repayment during 2010. Interest on all facilities currently\\nheld is charged at floating interest rates and the Company assesses the requirement for fixing interest\\nrates on a regular basis. The effect on the income statement of a 1% rise and a 1% fall in interest rates has been calculated to\\nassess interest rate sensitivity. Credit risk\\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations. Deposits already received can be retained by the Company. The Company therefore considers that\\nadequate security is held against each individual balance. Surplus cash is held in secure bank deposit accounts with banks that have high credit ratings as set by\\ninternational credit rating agencies. Liquidity risk\\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its\\nobligations as they fall due. The Company considers that current unutilised facilities are sufficient to cover funding requirements in the\\nforeseeable future. An explanation of each IFRS that has resulted in a restatement of the figures prepared under UK GAAP is\\ngiven below. There is no impact on the Company's cash flows. Previously land\\npurchased on extended payment terms was recognised at the cost determined in the purchase contract. Adjusting this to\\nfair value has reduced the liability by £73,000 and reduced inventories by the same amount. FARRINGDON ST\\nWATERLOO RD.

       " \" Our development pipeline is very\\nhealthy at over 2,200 homes. We have\\nbeen appointed as their partner on a\\nfurther five estates which we expect to\\ndevelop over the next five years. I am delighted that a number of new\\nshareholders have been added to our\\nregister during the year and I hope that\\nthey are looking forward to the next\\nfew years as much as I am. Turnover\\nhas grown by 32% to £104.4 million\\nand profit before tax is up 35%\\nto £13.5 million. Included within this figure are 16 homes\\nbeing constructed under joint ventures\\nwhere we recognise half of the turnover\\nand profit from the development. This secures future cash flows\\nand enables us to invest further in our\\ndevelopment pipeline. Despite this\\nthe rate of sales has been impressive\\nwith handovers not due to commence\\nuntil November this year. To date we\\nhave sold 123 of the 184 private homes\\nin the first construction phase. Partnerships\\nwith affordable housing providers\\nremain integral to our business and\\ntypically 35% of any development is\\nsold for affordable housing. Some of the land acquired benefited\\nfrom detailed planning permission such\\nthat development could commence\\nalmost immediately. Development is now\\nunderway and will be completed in\\n2009. A number of land acquisitions were\\nsubject to receipt of satisfactory\\nplanning permission. The contract is subject to\\nreceipt of planning permission for 372\\nhomes which is expected in the next few\\nmonths. We have also added to our medium to\\nlonger term development pipeline with\\nthe acquisition of sites that we will\\nprogress through the planning process. We\\nhave secured this partnership due to\\nthe quality of the Telford Homes brand\\nwhich incorporates a straight-forward\\nand honest approach. I would like to\\nthank each and every one of our\\nemployees for their efforts this year. An analysis\\nof properties sold in the year is given in\\nthe Chief Executive’s review. The operating margin has fallen to\\n16.0% from 16.2% with overheads\\nreducing as a percentage of turnover\\nto 6.4% from 6.8% last year. Interest\\nInterest paid in the year was £4.0\\nmillion up from £3.1 million last year. Interest cover\\nwas 5.2 times in 2007 which remains\\nwell within acceptable limits. Profit before tax has increased to £13.5\\nmillion from £10.0 million last year. Taxation\\nThe effective tax charge for the year is\\n26.3% down from 29.7% last year. Dividends\\nA final dividend of 4.9p per ordinary\\nshare has been proposed. The total dividend last year was 7.0p. The final dividend is expected to be\\npaid on 13th July 2007 to shareholders\\non the register on 22nd June 2007. The 5.8 million shares issued as\\na result of the share placing diluted\\nearnings for five months. The funds\\nraised will make a more significant\\ncontribution to profits in 2008 and to\\na greater extent in 2009 and 2010. The number\\nof shares in issue is now almost 37\\nmillion. Net assets per share at 31st\\nMarch were 148p up from 108p last year. Total facilities are therefore £178\\nmillion with actual drawn loans at 31st\\nMarch 2007 being £73.2 million. This reduction is a\\ndirect result of the cash balances held at\\nthe end of the year. We are comfortable\\nwith higher levels of gearing as we\\ncontinue to monitor the certainty of\\nfuture cash inflows against exposure to\\ndebt. The board has\\ndetermined that levels of uncovered\\ngearing are acceptable up to 100%. Cash flow\\nWe maintain a detailed cash flow\\nforecast as part of our management\\ninformation systems. This extends for a\\nnumber of years into the future and is\\nsubject to continual re-assessment. The cash flow position is reported to\\nthe board and our banking partners on\\na monthly basis. We\\nhave already explored all current\\ninternational standards that may have\\nan impact on the accounting policies\\nemployed by the Company. There are no\\nmaterial issues expected to arise from\\nthe standards already in place other than\\npresentational changes. International\\nstandards are evolving over time and\\nnew standards will be appraised as and\\nwhen they are issued. These can\\nthen be used as comparatives for the\\nfirst full year of adoption in 2008. While the opportunities to utilise\\nour competitive advantage remain we\\nwill continue to play a significant role in\\nthe regeneration of the area. The\\ntower at Icona in Stratford is now\\nprominent on the East London skyline\\nand OneStratford is rapidly rising from\\nthe ground a short distance away. A number of planning permissions are\\nbeing sought requiring careful\\nmanagement to make the process as\\nsmooth as possible. A trainee programme has been set up\\nwith a regular cycle of trainees being\\nrecruited each year. This will contribute\\nto the long term future of the Company\\nas well as the construction industry as a\\nwhole. Construction standards have been\\nmaintained at the high level expected in\\nTelford Homes. We continue to invest in the training and development of our people to\\nnot only meet but exceed industry requirements. Our Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) is at an all time low and below the industry average. The increase in activity is being\\neffectively managed by our construction teams without putting health and safety at risk. We continue to identify new ways of working to reduce wasteful practices and processes. One example of this is the ‘bathroom\\npods’ being installed on a number of our developments. Mark Parker and John Fitzgerald continue to be responsible for health and safety in each of the operating divisions with the assistance of\\nSteve Nicoll. “One of the main reasons for joining Telford Homes was the passion I witnessed in everyone I met. A few months on I have not\\nseen anybody within the Company that does not share in the aspirations of the business. This is reinforced on site by the\\ncommitment and integrity of the site teams in undertaking their duties in a professional manner. My main goal is to further\\ndevelop and monitor policies and procedures in the light of the continuing growth of the Company. • Ensuring that all operations take account of the Environmental Protection Act. • Undertaking regular reviews of our working practices to minimise pollution and waste. • Ensuring that contractors involved in the removal of waste are registered carriers. • Assessment of any environmental impact when performing risk assessments for the control of substances hazardous to health. • A commitment to achieving high levels of energy efficiency and water management in all of our operations. • Timber from sustainable sources is now used exclusively on all developments. • Methods of harnessing natural energy such as solar panels and ground source heat pumps are being incorporated into a\\nnumber of developments. • We are increasing our use of pre-fabricated external walls and bathroom pods and these reduce waste as they are\\nmanufactured off-site. • Ecological reports have helped us to assess the ways in which existing species can be nurtured once a development is complete. Bat\\nboxes and brown roofs have been positive additions to recent developments to enhance the built environment for urban wildlife. In addition to our commitment to the environment we consider our social responsibility in a wider sense to be of vital\\nimportance in the areas in which we operate. The regeneration of East London is an ongoing project in which we are playing a major role. We have excellent relationships with local councils and housing associations and we are extremely\\nsupportive of the need to provide affordable housing for shared ownership and for rent. Throughout the year we have worked alongside the local authorities to encourage employment of local labour on our projects. • 'Snagging' every unit across all developments to achieve finishing consistency. • Pre-Completion Inspections with customers. • Thorough demonstration on handover for trouble-free ownership. • Inductions for new tenants (showing how to use the home prevents most running-in problems). • An emergency back-up service for the times when our offices are closed and help is needed. • Communication of build progress, completion dates and running-in advice. • Listening to feedback for future improvements.

The\\nboard meets once a month and the directors make every effort to attend all board meetings. Management\\ninformation systems are in place to enable the directors to make informed decisions to properly discharge their duties. The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separate. The Chairman is responsible for running the board and he meets\\nregularly and separately with the Chief Executive and the other non-executive director to discuss matters for the board. One third of the directors retire annually in rotation in accordance\\nwith the Company’s articles of association. This enables the shareholders to decide on the election of their Company’s board. The directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements as set out in the statement of\\ndirectors’ responsibilities. The responsibilities of the auditors are set out in their report. Remuneration committee\\nDetails concerning the composition and meetings of the remuneration committee are contained in the directors’ remuneration\\nreport on pages 39 to 40. The committee has a responsibility for reviewing the financial statements provided to shareholders. All board members present at the AGM are available to answer questions from shareholders.

Going concern\\nThe directors consider that the funds available to the Company are sufficient for its operation for the foreseeable future. Composition of the remuneration committee\\nThe remuneration committee comprises the independent non-executive directors, David Holland and Robert Clarke. The\\ncommittee makes recommendations to the board on executive directors’ service agreements and remuneration. In doing so it has\\nundertaken relevant research to ensure that remuneration levels are competitive with the industry average. The committee met\\ntwice during the year. Both schemes are dependent on the Company meeting certain financial\\nperformance targets. The maximum amount that can be earned under the executive bonus scheme is 100% of basic salary. The board as a whole determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors after considering external market research. They do not participate in the bonus schemes or in the group personal pension scheme. They are entitled to participate in the SIP. Service contracts\\nThe executive directors have service contracts that can be terminated on 12 months notice. These provide for termination\\npayments equivalent to 12 months basic salary and contractual benefits. The non-executive directors have letters of appointment that can be terminated on three months notice. On that date the market value of the shares was 223p resulting in a gain of £59,798. The primary key performance indicators are disclosed on page 1. All shares purchased under the SIP are matched by shares provided by the Company on a\\none for one basis. Creditors\\nIt is Company policy to settle all debts with its creditors on a timely basis. Subcontractors are paid upon agreement of the value\\nof works completed based on their applications for payment and the terms agreed. In general, other suppliers are paid during the\\nmonth following the month of receipt of the invoice unless other terms have been specifically agreed.

Telford Homes is an equal opportunities employer and all applications for employment are considered fully on the\\nbasis of suitability for the job. Charitable donations\\nThe Company made charitable donations of £14,100 (2006 - £9,600). These donations were made to a number of different\\ncharities supporting a broad range of good causes. Auditors\\nThe directors considered the appointment of auditors during 2006 and, following a competitive tender, decided to appoint\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Accordingly Moore Stephens LLP have resigned as auditors of Telford Homes Plc. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements. The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the\\nfinancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention\\nand detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom\\ngoverning the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and\\nInternational Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the report of the\\ndirectors is consistent with the financial statements. We consider the\\nimplications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial\\nstatements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. Basis of audit opinion\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices\\nBoard. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial\\nstatements. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall\\nadequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

This charge is calculated at\\nthe date of grant of the options and is charged equally over the vesting period. The corresponding adjustment to\\nreserves is made directly to the profit and loss reserve. Accounting convention\\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable\\nUK accounting standards. All turnover is generated in the United\\nKingdom. Commission received on property sales made on behalf of third parties is recorded within turnover, with all\\ncosts associated with the sale of those properties recognised within cost of sales. Profit on developments is recognised over the life of each development in proportion to turnover only to the extent\\nthat the total eventual profit on the development can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Until there is reasonable\\ncertainty over the final outcome of a development the profit is restricted to the non-refundable deposits received. Losses are provided for as soon as foreseen. Development properties\\nDevelopment properties are included in stocks and work in progress and are stated at the lower of cost and net\\nrealisable value. Cost comprises costs of acquisition and development, including directly attributable fees and\\nexpenses but not loan interest. Included within development properties are freehold interests held in completed\\ndevelopments. These are recognised at a multiple of annual rental income. Tangible fixed assets and depreciation\\nTangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Finance leases and hire purchase contracts\\nAssets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and depreciated over the shorter of\\ntheir expected useful lives and the lease term. Operating leases\\nOperating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred. The impact of the change on the calculation of deferred tax is not\\nconsidered to be material. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary\\nshares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Island Gardens Limited is a dormant company with share capital of £2. Interest is payable at rates up to 1.75% over base\\nrate. Details of facilities are given in note 23.

Awards\\nunder each scheme are made periodically to new employees. This charge is calculated at the date\\nof grant of the options and is charged equally over the vesting period. The corresponding adjustment to reserves is\\nmade directly to the profit and loss reserve. Individual calculations have been performed for groups of share options with differing exercise prices and dates. The profit and loss reserve is therefore restated by the deferred tax credit of £13,000 from £11,056,000 to £11,069,000. The profit and loss reserve is therefore restated by cumulative deferred tax credits of\\n£31,000 from £16,493,000 to £16,524,000. The share price at the point of exercise of share options during the year ranged from 223p to 310.5p. This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and confers certain tax\\nadvantages for participating employees. The SIP provides for employees to purchase shares up to a value of £1,500 in each tax year. These shares are known\\nas 'Partnership shares'. Dividends are paid on both\\nPartnership and Matching shares and these are allocated to employees as 'Dividend shares'. The costs associated with the trust are paid for by the Company and the Company finances all share purchases. The trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating in the scheme. These shares remain in the trust until such time as an employee withdraws from the SIP. Further shares have been\\nallocated to employees as Matching shares and the cost of these shares is being written off over the three year\\nholding period. The dividends on shares in which the trust has an interest are waived. Shares held by the SIP are recognised as a deduction from shareholders funds. Movements in the profit and loss reserve relating to the SIP are\\nshown in note 16. The loan has a\\nlimited recourse such that repayment is limited to the value of the shares on the repayment date. The Company will\\nlend the trustee sufficient funds to enable the trustee to provide the loans to individual participants. Offers to participants will be made periodically at the discretion of the directors of Telford Homes Plc. These shares were issued on 9th November 2006. On this date the Company provided a loan to the\\ntrustee of £1,430,000 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. Contracts\\nwere exchanged on 26th July 2006 at a price of £245,000. This purchase was approved by shareholders at the\\nExtraordinary General Meeting held on 23rd October 2006. Subsequently contracts were exchanged on 11th\\nDecember 2006 for a parking space at the same development at a price of £17,500. The directors are of the opinion that the\\nsales were made at open market prices. This purchase was approved at a previous Annual General Meeting. These purchases were approved at a previous Annual General Meeting. 20  Commitments\\nThe Company had no capital commitments at either 31st March 2007 or 31st March 2006. The private sales proceeds are expected to be in excess of £100 million. The facilities are due for review before April 2008. A total of\\n£25.2 million was unutilised at 31st March 2007. This facility is due for review by April 2008. A total of £79.6 million was unutilised at 31st March 2007. 65 Annual report and accounts 07\\nR&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:29  Page 66 WA N S T E A D \\nFLAT S \\nFA I R\\nWA T\\nHOSPITAL  \\nHILL WOOD \\nW A L THAMSTOW \\nMARSHES \\nEPPING FOREST \\nBUCKHIRST \\nHILL \\nM11 \\nM11 \\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n     R O U N D W A Y            B R U C E G R O V E \\n                H I G H R O A D A 1 0 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nG R E A T C A M B R I D G E R O A D A 1 0 \\nG R E E N L A N E S \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n            W O O D F O R D N E W R O A D \\n            H I G H R O A D   E P P I N G N E W R O A D  \\n \\n  \\nF O R E S T R O A D \\n     B R O A D    L A N E        \\n         \\nWA T E RME A D W AY  \\n \\n \\n           M E R I D I A N W AY \\nF O RE S T R E E T  \\n              H E R TF O R D R O A D  \\nH I G H R O A D \\n      H E R M ON H I L L \\n \\n          \\nC H I G W E L L R O A D \\n \\n \\n \\nH I G H R O A D   \\n \\n \\nA1 2 \\n A 1 2  E A S T E R N A V E N U E \\n            H E D G E L A N E \\n \\nL O R D S H I P L A N E \\n               W E ST G R E E N R O A D \\nS T A T I O N R O A D \\nR A N G E R S R\\n           H O E S T R E E T \\n       C H I N G F O R D R O A D  O L D C H U R C H ROA D \\n \\n \\n \\nC R A N B R O O K R O A D \\n \\n H A I N A U L T R O A D \\n               A 1 3        A L F R E D S W AY \\nH I G H R O A\\n              C R A N B R O O K R O A D \\n \\n                 C R A N B R O O K R O A D \\nHIGH S T R EET S O U T H H I G H S T R E E T N O R T H \\n                R O M F O R D R O A D \\nS H E A D \\n            K I N G S R O A D \\n \\nW H I T E H A L L R O A D \\nW O O D F O R D R D  \\n     H I G H R O A D \\n    A 4 0 6 N O R T H C I R C U L A R R O A D \\n                S T E R L I N G W AY      A N G E L R O A D           L E A V A L L E Y V I A D U C T          A 4 0 6                       S O U T H E N D R O A D \\n \\nA 4 0 6 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nS O U T H W O O D F O R D R O A D  A 4 0 6                    \\nB A R K I N G R E L I E F R O A D     A 4 0 6 \\n A 4 0 6  \\nR O YA L D O C K S R O A D \\nN E W R O A D  \\n \\nC H I N G F O R D L A N E \\nLONDON \\nCITY \\nAIRPORT \\nRIVER THAMES \\nR O YA L A L B E R T W AY \\n  A L B E R T WAY \\nA 2 0 5   J O H N W I L S O N S T R E E T         A C A D E M Y R O A D \\n \\nFINSBU RY \\nP ARK \\nW ANSTEAD \\nGOL F \\nCOURS E \\nT H A \\nW O OLWICH FER RY \\nM E S \\nF L O O D \\nB A R R I E R \\nR I V E R   L E A \\nWEST \\nR ESERV OI R \\nEAST \\nRESERV OIR \\nB R I D G E \\nF A R R I N G D O N R D .

This is an excellent result and reflects the continuing \\nstrong trading performance of the business. This transaction involved us purchasing two \\nof their subsidiaries, Gas Plus Supply Limited and Electricity Plus Supply Limited, for a total consideration \\nof £218m (of which £21.5m is deferred for three years). As a result, we have earned a higher level of trust amongst our customers than any other utility supplier, \\nconsistent endorsements from Which? in their regular surveys, and a Net Promoter Score that typically \\nfluctuates between +40 and +45 on a monthly basis.

As a result, all our core services are now seeing strong \\nmonthly growth. This remains significantly below the average level of prepayment \\nmeters within the industry of around 15%. This transaction has given rise to the creation of a significant intangible asset in the balance sheet of the \\nGroup. CASH, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL\\nOur cash balances at the year-end increased to £45.4m (2013: £3.4m). Facilities have been arranged \\nwith Barclays Bank to enable us to fund these costs without affecting our progressive dividend policy. SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEME CHARGES\\nOperating profit is stated after share incentive scheme charges of £4.2m (2013: £0.9m). As a result of the increasing relative importance of share incentive scheme charges as a proportion \\nof our pre-tax profits, we are separately disclosing this amount within the Consolidated Statement of \\nComprehensive Income for the period (and excluding these charges from our calculation of adjusted profits \\nand earnings). Our current earnings per \\nshare have therefore been adjusted to eliminate these share incentive scheme charges. TAXATION\\nA full analysis of the taxation charge for the year is set out in note 4 to the financial statements. The tax \\ncharge for the year is £7.7m (2013: £7.6m). As a reseller, the Group does not own any of the network \\ninfrastructure required to deliver its services to customers. Back-ups of both the software and underlying billing and customer data are made on a regular basis  \\nand securely stored off-site. LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY RISK\\nThe Group is subject to varying laws and regulations, including possible adverse effects from European \\nregulatory intervention. Amendments to the regulatory regime could have an impact on the Group’s ability to achieve its financial \\ngoals. The Group is a licensed gas and electricity supplier, and therefore has a direct regulatory relationship \\nwith Ofgem. If the Group fails to maintain an effective relationship with Ofgem and comply with its licence \\nobligations, it could be subject to fines or to the removal of its respective licences. Fraud within the telephony industry may arise from customers using the services without intending to pay \\ntheir supplier. The amounts involved are generally relatively small as the Group has sophisticated call traffic \\nmonitoring systems to identify material occurrences of fraud. on their CashBack card) or goods (e.g. Smartphones and Tablets) from the Group; the Group \\nregularly reviews and refines its fraud protection systems to reduce its potential exposure to such risks. The wholesale price can be extremely volatile, and customer demand can be \\nsubject to considerable short term fluctuations depending on the weather. The Group \\noffers a unique multiservice proposition. The increasing proportion of customers who are benefiting from \\na genuine multi-utility solution, that is unavailable from any other known supplier, materially reduces any \\ncompetitive threat. The Group’s \\nservices and expertise may be rendered obsolete or uneconomic by technological advances or novel \\napproaches developed by one or more of the Group’s competitors. The existing approaches of the Group’s \\ncompetitors or new approaches or technologies developed by such competitors may be more effective \\nor affordable than those supplied to the Group. This should ensure \\nthat the Group has direct access to new technologies and services available to the market. INFRASTRUCTURE RISK\\nThe provision of services to the Group’s customers is reliant on the efficient operation of third party physical \\ninfrastructure. There is a risk of disruption to the supply of services to customers through any failure in \\nthe infrastructure e.g. gas shortages, power cuts or damage to communications networks. We pay considerable attention \\nto recruiting, developing and retaining people with appropriate skills. Everyone who successfully completes this programme celebrates their achievement \\nat a quarterly graduation ceremony, where they are presented with a certificate and champagne by the \\nChief Executive. We promote from within where possible into both \\nspecialist and managerial roles. Our monthly Employee Recognition Awards enable the Company to celebrate and reward employees who \\nhave gone ‘over and above’ in the performance of their role. We actively seek to engage all our employees in changes that may concern them, rather than just a \\nrepresentative few on a committee. We also have a ‘Fun Fund’ set aside for departmental social events. Each \\nSeptember we run our ‘Fit Pig Week’ to promote health and well-being within the Company with a range of \\nfun events and incentives. With the exception of our logistics \\nteam, all our employees work together in Network HQ, our Head Office building in London. We operate a \\nheavily subsidised staff restaurant, and provide a recreation room in both our Head Office and warehouse \\npremises. The exercise price is the market price at the time of granting the \\noption. promotion). We encourage all employees to participate in a stakeholder pension scheme operated by Aviva. Participants can choose their own contribution level, which is matched by the Company within certain \\nlimits, depending on length of service.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\\nThe Board meets regularly to review the progress of the Company and to discuss the measures required for \\nits future development. Records of meetings and the decisions of the Board are maintained by the Company Secretary and are \\napproved by the Board at the following meeting. Any question of the removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the \\nBoard as a whole. The non-executive \\ndirectors attended such formal, externally facilitated courses as they considered relevant to their roles and \\nresponsibilities during the year. •  Assessing performance in the light of the Company’s strategy and objectives. •  Ensuring an effective system of risk management and internal controls is in place. •  Reviewing the Company’s overall corporate governance arrangements. •  Approval of the Company’s financial statements prior to publication. utilitywarehouse.co.uk). An internal evaluation of the Board for the current year was conducted through the completion of formal \\ndetailed board, and board committee evaluation questionnaires by each director. In addition a review \\ninvolving each director was carried out. The results of this \\nevaluation were entirely satisfactory. BOARD BALANCE AND DIVERSITY\\nThe Board has remained unchanged during the year and consists of three executive directors and three \\nindependent non-executive directors. Julian Schild acts as the Company’s Deputy Chairman and Senior \\nIndependent Non-Executive Director. The Committee will continue to adhere to the principles set out above in \\nidentifying and recruiting the best candidates for any future Board roles in a non-discriminatory manner. Further detail regarding the Company’s position in relation to encouraging diversity within all layers of the \\norganisation is set out in the “People and Organisation” section of the Strategic Report on pages 29 to 31. SUPPLY OF INFORMATION\\nInformation is supplied to the Board in a timely manner with board papers and accounts being provided in \\nadvance of meetings. When the Board requests additional information it is provided. Therefore all the directors will be submitted for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General \\nMeeting in July. The Directors’ Remuneration Report, \\ngiving the details of the emoluments of each director, may be found on pages 48 to 67. The activities \\nof the Audit Committee are set out on pages 44 to 47. During PKF’s tenure, and in accordance with ethical procedures, audit partners rotated \\nevery five years. The main purpose of the Nomination Committee is to make recommendations to the \\nBoard on the appointment of new directors. The activities of the Nomination Committee are set out on page 43. RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS\\nIt is the policy of the Company to maintain a dialogue with institutional shareholders and to keep them \\ninformed about the objectives of the business. ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\\nNotice of the Annual General Meeting and related papers are sent to all shareholders at least 20 working \\ndays before the meeting. Proxy votes are counted and the meeting \\nis advised of the number of proxies lodged for and against each resolution. The Chairmen of the Audit, \\nRemuneration and Nomination Committees and the remaining non-executive directors are available to \\nanswer questions. Shareholders who attend are invited to ask questions and take part in the meeting. INTERNAL CONTROL\\nThe Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management. However it recognises that any system can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against \\nmaterial misstatement or loss. The results of these reviews are recorded in a formal document which sets \\nout a detailed evaluation of each risk and the associated internal control in place to mitigate that risk. No material weaknesses in internal controls were identified during the year. The \\nprincipal risks faced by the Company and the measures taken to address these risks are set out in the \\nStrategic Report on pages 24 to 28. SHARE CAPITAL AND VOTING RIGHTS\\nDetails of the Company’s share capital and substantial shareholdings can be found in the Directors’ Report \\nunder the capital structure and substantial shareholders sections on pages 69 and 70. Michael Pavia is also identified as having recent and \\nrelevant financial experience. The review covers all material controls, \\nincluding financial, operational and compliance controls. The actions taken by the Committee in regard to these are described in the \\ntable below. Valuation and recoverability of trade receivables Review of key assumptions underlying the recoverability \\nof trade receivables based on historical experience. Revenue recognition and recoverability of unbilled  \\nenergy revenues\\nReview of key assumptions underlying the recoverability \\nof unbilled energy revenues based on industry reports \\nand historical experience. As part of this process the \\nAudit Committee has also considered the need for any special projects or internal investigations and \\nconcluded that no such projects or investigations have been required. The Committee would normally be likely to prohibit the provision of \\nthe following types of non-audit related work by the Company’s external auditor:\\n•  book-keeping and work relating to the preparation of accounting records and financial statements that \\nwill ultimately be subject to external audit;\\n•  financial information system design and implementation; \\n•  appraisal or valuation services in respect of material assets;\\n•  internal auditing;\\n•  investment advice or corporate broking; and\\n•  any other work where mutual interests exist that could compromise the independence of the  \\nexternal auditor. No such matters were raised by \\nemployees during the current year. The Company’s remuneration policy is set in full on pages 49 to 57. We are totally aware that we operate \\nwithin a competitive environment and aim to reward senior executives fairly - but not excessively. We would \\nnot expect total remuneration to fall within the upper quartile relative to comparable organisations over the \\nlong term. At present, executive directors are not paid bonuses in either cash or shares. As part of our remit, we have reviewed the performance of the Chief Executive and Finance Director. Andrew Lindsay played an outstanding role in the successful negotiation of the new energy supply \\narrangements with Npower. Finally, I should like to thank our shareholders for their support and constructive engagement over the  \\npast year. The Company’s current remuneration policy is based on the principle that the fortunes of the directors \\nand senior management should be directly aligned with those of external shareholders, and this is \\npredominantly achieved through the use of share incentive plans. Base salary is paid in 12 \\nequal monthly instalments \\nduring the year. Base salaries are reviewed \\nannually and any changes \\nare effective from 1 April \\neach year. None, although overall \\nperformance of the \\nindividual is considered \\nby the Committee when \\nsetting and reviewing \\nsalaries. Benefits\\nTo provide benefits \\ncommensurate with the role \\nand market practice. The Company pays for \\nprivate healthcare for each \\ndirector and their immediate \\nfamily. Market cost of the provision \\nof private healthcare, \\ncompany cars and other \\nbenefits as applicable from \\ntime to time. None. Bonus payment to be \\ndependent on achievement \\nof performance measures. Maximum potential bonus \\nof 200% of annual Base \\nSalary, including the value \\nof any share incentive \\nawards granted, as \\ndetailed below. The overall combined limit \\nfor annual cash bonuses \\nand share incentive \\nawards to be 200% of \\nannual Base Salary. These shares are then \\nexpected to be retained  \\nfor the director’s period  \\nof service. Bonus to be paid at \\nthe discretion of the \\nRemuneration Committee \\nand based on the formal \\nrecommendation of the \\nChairman. Maximum potential bonus \\nof 10% of base salary in \\nany one year. Issue of share incentives at \\nmarket price on the date of \\ngrant which provide direct \\nand transparent exposure \\nto the Company share price \\nfor the director. Grants made periodically, \\nwith awards vesting over 3 \\nto 7 years. share options to be valued at \\none third of the market value \\nof the shares under option. Vesting is dependent on \\nservice and the achievement \\nof performance conditions. 30% vests at threshold \\nperformance. Pension\\nTo provide funding for \\nretirement. Defined contribution \\npension scheme open to all \\nemployees and executive \\ndirectors. Company contributes up to \\na maximum of 20% of Base \\nSalary per annum. None. Shareholding Requirement\\nTo strengthen the long term \\nalignment of directors’ \\ninterests with those of all \\nshareholders. Adjusted EPS \\nis considered appropriate as a key strategic objective of the Company is to drive profitable growth in each \\nyear. Targets for Adjusted EPS are set by reference to \\ninternal budgeting plans and external market expectations. TSR targets are set on a standard practice, median \\nto upper quartile ranking range. Only 30% of share incentive awards vest for threshold levels of performance. The Committee wishes to retain the ability to change the composition of performance conditions for future \\ngrants to directors should this be required in order to appropriately reflect the strategic responsibilities of \\nthe particular director concerned. ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY\\nThe bar chart below seeks to illustrate the potential rewards available under the proposed remuneration \\npolicy for the coming financial year under varying levels of performance. The amounts included for share incentive awards are based on one third of the market value of the shares \\nunder option. SERVICE CONTRACTS AND POLICY FOR PAYMENT FOR LOSS OF OFFICE\\nThe table below sets out the Company’s policy regarding service contracts and payments for loss of office. Standard provision Policy Details Other  \\nprovisions in  \\nservice contracts\\nNotice periods in executive \\ndirectors’ service contracts. 6 - 12 months notice from \\nthe Company. 6 - 12 months notice from \\nthe executive director. Executive directors may be required to \\nwork during notice period or may be \\nprovided with pay in lieu of notice if \\nnot required to work full notice. All executive directors are subject to \\nannual re-election by shareholders. N/A\\nCompensation for loss of \\noffice in service contracts. No contractual provision \\nfor additional compensation \\nin the event of loss of \\noffice resulting from poor \\nperformance. All awards lapse except \\nfor “good leavers”: i.e. N/A\\nExercise of discretion. Discretion to be used only in \\nexceptional circumstances. Non-executive directors \\nare appointed for an initial \\nterm of one year which is \\nthen reviewed by the Board \\non annual basis thereafter. Non-executive directors are all \\nsubject to annual re-election by \\nshareholders at the Company’s AGM \\neach year. Non-executive directors have a three \\nmonth notice period and there is \\nno provision for compensation if \\nrequired to stand down. Non-executive \\ndirectors have \\nthe right to seek \\nindependent \\nprofessional \\nadvice at the \\nexpense of the \\nCompany in the \\npursuance of  \\ntheir duties. APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION\\nThe Committee’s approach to recruitment is to pay a sufficient amount necessary to attract the best \\ncandidates to the particular role. cash or shares) save that the Committee may award the whole of \\nthe value in shares, at its discretion. Non-executive directors’ \\nfees are set by the Board \\nas a whole and aligned \\nwith the responsibilities of \\neach director. Annual fees are paid in 12 \\nequal monthly instalments \\nduring the year. Non-executive directors’ \\nfees are periodically \\nreviewed by the Board in \\nthe light of any changes in \\nrole and prevailing market \\nrates for non-executive \\ndirectors in similarly sized \\nlisted companies. Non-executive directors’ \\nremuneration will not be set \\noutside the parameters of \\nprevailing market rates for \\nsimilarly-sized companies \\nof equal complexity. Non-executive directors are \\nnot eligible to participate \\nin any performance-related \\narrangements or share \\nincentive schemes. As a result of previous feedback received, and as described in the Remuneration \\nCommittee report for this year below, the Committee decided to reduce the threshold vesting level for share \\noptions and increase the level of challenge in the performance conditions set. The Company does not deem it appropriate to formally consult with employees regarding the determination \\nof the directors’ remuneration policy as the broad remuneration structure for directors mirrors that of all \\nemployees, i.e. Mr Wigoder received an increase of 2.8% to £370,000 and Mr Lindsay an increase \\nof 8.3% to £390,000. The non-executive directors receive fees for their services, the details of which are described below. The \\nlevel of these fees was unchanged during the year. The first share \\noption plan and the JSOP are available to employees, and the second share option plan is available to the \\nCompany’s independent distributors. The trustee of the JSOP \\nShare Trust is Barclays Wealth Trustees (Guernsey) Limited. It is currently considered unlikely by the Committee that further \\nawards will be made under the JSOP. The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan\\nThe Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives and rewards to those \\ndistributors who have been most successful in gathering new customers for the Company. These performance conditions will involve distributors consistently gathering customers throughout the three-\\nyear vesting periods of the options. These options will vest in \\ntwo discrete tranches of 25,000 over three and five year vesting periods, each representing shares with a \\nface value of £434,750 representing approximately 150% of Mr Houghton’s annual base salary. These options were made subject to performance conditions as described in detail below. At the year end the Company’s share price was 1,793p and the range during the financial year was \\n1,035p to 1,914p. These provide notice periods of three months \\non either side for the non-executive directors and the following notice periods for the executive directors: Mr \\nWigoder twelve months on either side and Mr Lindsay and Mr Houghton each with six months on either side. PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE REMUNERATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE\\nThe following table shows the change in certain aspects of the remuneration of Mr Lindsay. The size of the increase \\nawarded to Mr Lindsay reflected the increased responsibility inherent in his role specifically as the size of \\nthe Company grew during the period. The increase also reflected the relative level of his salary compared \\nto chief executives of other similarly-sized publicly listed companies. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPEND ON PAY\\nThe Regulations require an illustration of the significance of the Company’s expenditure on pay in the \\ncontext of its operations. Set out below is a summary of the Company’s levels of expenditure on pay and \\nother significant cash outflows to key stakeholders. The Committee will be mindful of the size of this award when considering any future awards to Mr \\nLindsay in future. It is expected that \\neach performance measure will be given an equal weighting. The base year for measuring performance \\nwill be the year ended 31 March 2014. PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS REVIEW\\nA full review of the development of the business is contained in the Strategic Report on pages 3 to 33. A \\nsummary of the financial risk management objectives and policies is contained in note 19 to the financial \\nstatements. This Directors’ Report, together with the information in the Strategic Report forms the management report for \\nthe purposes of DTR 4.1.8R. A final dividend of 19p per \\nshare (2013: 18p per share) is proposed. The Articles \\nmay be amended by way of a special resolution of the members of the Company. The rules relating to the appointment and replacement of \\ndirectors are contained within the Articles. The Articles provide that Directors may be appointed by an \\nordinary resolution of the members or by a resolution of the Directors, provided that, in the latter instance, \\na director appointed in that way retires at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment. DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\\nThe Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations where they have, or could have, a direct or indirect \\ninterest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Company’s interests. The Companies Act 2006 and \\nthe Company’s Articles allow the Board to authorise such conflicts of interest should this be deemed to be \\nappropriate. The Board has put in place effective procedures for managing and, where appropriate, approving conflicts or \\npotential conflicts of interest. The Board will, where appropriate, authorise a conflict or potential conflict, and \\nwill impose all necessary restrictions and/or conditions where it sees fit. The Company maintains a register of \\ndirectors’ conflicts of interest which is reviewed regularly by the Board. Neither the insurance nor the indemnity \\nprovides cover where a director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly. EMPLOYEES\\nThe requirements of the Companies Act 2006 in respect of employees are set out in the Strategic Report on \\npages 29 to 31. Prior to vesting, all voting and dividend rights attached to these shares have \\nbeen waived. The Company intends to renew this authority at this year’s AGM. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION\\nEach of the directors has confirmed that so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information of \\nwhich the Company’s auditor is unaware, and that he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken \\nas a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the \\nCompany’s auditor is aware of that information. The Company has considerable financial resources together with a large and diverse retail and small \\nbusiness customer base and long term contracts with a number of key suppliers. As a consequence, the \\ndirectors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. They \\nare also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for \\nthe prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. WEBSITE PUBLICATION\\nThe directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the financial statements are made available \\non a website. Financial statements are published on the company’s website in accordance with legislation \\nin the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may \\nvary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the company’s website is \\nthe responsibility of the directors. The directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the \\nfinancial statements contained therein. This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all audit differences individually \\nin excess of £50,000. We also agreed to report differences below these thresholds that, in our view, \\nwarranted reporting on qualitative grounds. Overview of the scope of our audit\\nA description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the FRC’s website at  \\nwww.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. We \\nhave discussed our assessment of the risks of material misstatement with the Audit Committee who have set \\nout on pages 44 to 47 of their report consideration of these risks. VALUATION AND RECOVERABILITY OF TRADE RECEIVABLES\\nThe reported trade receivables balance is largely \\nrepresented by customers who have debt assigned to \\ntheir prepayment meter or have defaulted on a payment. A degree of estimation is required in \\ndetermining this accrued revenue. In addition management have made certain valuation \\nprovisions against the receivable which requires \\nestimation judgement. Specifically, we considered evidence that supports the \\npropensity of customers to under-report energy usage, \\nand usage levels which have not been independently \\nverified. We examined the significant accounting estimates \\nand judgements relevant to the financial statements for \\nevidence of bias by the directors. We also tested manual journal entries. We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. We have nothing to report arising from these \\nmatters or our review. We \\nhave nothing to report arising from our review. Going concern\\nAs required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 71 that the group is a \\ngoing concern. We have nothing to report arising from our review. We have not \\nidentified any such inconsistencies, apparent misstatements or misleading statements. Those standards require us \\nto comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 20 May 2014. More information regarding the intangible asset is set out in note 6 of these financial statements. (b) Basis of preparation \\nThe accounts are prepared on a going concern basis. The judgements, estimations, and \\nassumptions that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are \\ndetailed below. In future, actual \\nresults may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Those assumptions are \\ndescribed in note 18 and include, amongst others, the dividend yield, expected volatility, expected life of \\nthe options and number of options expected to vest. Further detail regarding the transaction and the associated accounting treatment are set out in note 21 \\nof these financial statements. By virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from presenting a statement of \\ncomprehensive income. The Company made a profit for the year of £18,811,000 (2013: £25,600,000). (c) Basis of consolidation\\n(i) Subsidiaries \\nThe Group’s financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Telecom Plus PLC and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group and are included until \\nthe date on which the Group ceases to control them. Control is recognised where an investor is expected \\nto receive, or has rights to, variable returns from its investment in the investee and has the ability to affect \\nthese returns through its power over the investee. Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on \\nconsolidation. (ii) Associates\\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary \\nnor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and \\noperating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. Losses of an \\nassociate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate are not recognised. An analysis of whether any subsidiaries acquired constitute businesses in their \\nown right is initially undertaken with reference to the guidance in IFRS 3. Where an acquired subsidiary does not constitute a business under IFRS 3 (i.e. it does not have, inter alia, \\nthe inputs, processes and outputs to function on a standalone basis) the acquisition of the subsidiary is \\ntreated as an acquisition of assets. The assets acquired are recorded at cost and no goodwill is recognised. Transaction costs are capitalised as part of the cost of acquisition. Where an acquired subsidiary constitutes a business under IFRS 3, the assets, liabilities and contingent \\nliabilities of the subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost \\nof acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is \\nreviewed for impairment at least annually and any impairment is recognised immediately in the Statement \\nof Comprehensive Income. The Company’s customers are invoiced in the month following that in which the services \\nare provided. The Company does not retain the insurance risk \\nfor these services. These estimates are based on historical usage information as adjusted for known factors such as \\nvariations in weather. (f) Interest income\\nInterest income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues, using the effective \\ninterest rate method. (g) Leases\\nPayments on operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line \\nbasis over the lease term. When assets are leased out \\nunder finance leases, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable. (i) Taxation\\nThe tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in the Statement of \\nComprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which \\ncase it is recognised in equity. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be \\navailable against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no \\nlonger probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. (j) Property, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less a provision for depreciation. No depreciation is provided on freehold land. (k) Intangible assets\\nIntangible assets which arise (e.g. If any such indication \\nexists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their \\nfair value less costs to sell and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit \\nexceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the \\nrecoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does \\nnot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment \\nloss had been recognised. Provision is made for any impairment in the value of these investments. In the Group accounts \\ninvestments in associated undertakings are shown at cost plus accumulated profits less any dividends \\nreceived from the associated undertakings. (o) Inventories\\nInventories principally include mobile telephones and other electronic equipment and are valued at the \\nlower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is measured on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value \\nrepresents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in \\nmarketing, selling and distribution. Financial instruments are recognised on the trade date when the Group becomes a party to the contractual \\nprovisions of the instrument. Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of a \\nfinancial instrument not at fair value through profit and loss, transactions costs that are directly attributable \\nto the acquisition or issue of the financial instrument. Financial instruments are derecognised on the trade date when the Group is no longer a party to the \\ncontractual provisions of the instrument. (q) Trade receivables\\nTrade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated \\nirrecoverable amounts. The interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the \\nshort credit period is not considered to be material. (r) Cash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits with banks and, for the purposes of the \\nCash Flow Statement, revolving credit facilities. (s) Borrowings\\nShort and long term borrowings comprise revolving credit facilities and bank loans. The fees associated \\nwith entering into borrowing facilities are capitalised and netted off against borrowings and amortised over \\nthe term of the borrowings. The charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income \\ntakes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest. All share option based remuneration is equity \\nsettled, except as set out below. JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a \\nbinomial pricing model. (x) Pensions\\nThe Group makes contributions to certain employees’ personal pension plans. These are charged to the \\nStatement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they become payable. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. The Board measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and segment result, \\nwhich is referred to as operating profit. The Group applies the same significant accounting policies across \\nboth operating segments. 2. Three (2013: three) directors had contributions paid to their personal \\npension schemes. On 26 February 2014 Mr Andrew Lindsay exercised 217,400 share options at an exercise price of \\n330.5p per share. Included within freehold land \\nand buildings is £7.9 million (2013: £7.9 million) of land which is not depreciated. Property, plant and \\nequipment is not depreciated until the asset is brought into use. The Group regularly monitors the carrying amount of its goodwill. The result of \\nthe review undertaken at 31 March 2014 indicated that no impairment was necessary. No reasonably \\npossible change in the assumptions used in the impairment calculation would give rise to an impairment  \\nof goodwill. TML is incorporated in England and Wales. Electricity Plus and \\nGas Plus are incorporated in England and Wales. 10. Offset against this figure is an \\nallowance for future credit losses of £1,523,000 (2013: £1,475,000), which is included in the allowance \\nfor credit losses of £16,038,000 (2013: £14,295,000). Interest that would be recognised from discounting \\nfuture cash receipts over the short credit period is not currently considered material. 12. The Transaction Facility is divided into two tranches: (i) Term Loan A of £70,000,000 repayable by 20 \\nDecember 2016; and (ii) Term Loan B of £30,000,000 repayable by 20 December 2015. Interest is \\ncharged in accordance with the schedule set out in the table below. The Term Loan A Opening Interest Rate \\nis 2.35%. The Working Capital Facilities carry interest at the same rate as Term Loan A and are repayable by 20 \\nDecember 2016. All bank loans are secured through a floating charge on the assets of the Group. The Transaction Facility is stated net of unamortised arrangement fees of £980,000 (2013: £Nil) on the \\nface of the Balance sheet. These costs have been capitalised and are being amortised evenly over the term \\nof the Transaction Facility. 14. These shares are included in \\nthe above total voting rights figure of 80,016,058. Capital management\\nThe Group’s overall objective when managing capital is to continue to provide attractive returns to \\nshareholders. The Group’s current capital management strategy is to retain sufficient working capital for day to day \\noperating requirements. This dividend will be subject to income tax at each recipient’s individual marginal \\nincome tax rate. The amount of the additional consideration reduces from £201 million to £11 million over the 20 year life \\nof the supply agreement. As it is not possible to measure directly the benefit received from these activities, the fair value of the benefit \\nreceived has been measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. The expected volatility for the share option arrangements \\nis based on historical volatility determined by the analysis of daily share price movements over the past  \\n12 months. DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\nTreasury activities take place under procedures and policies approved and monitored by the Board. They \\nare designed to minimise the financial risks faced by the Group which primarily arise from credit, interest \\nrate and liquidity risks. The Company has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers. The maximum credit risk for the Group is £213,536,000 (2013: £144,567,000) and for the Company \\n£63,811,000 (2013: £146,331,000). Interest rate risk \\nThe Group finances its day to day operations primarily through cash generated within the business. Cash \\nsurpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank PLC at money market rates to maximise returns. Liquidity risk\\nThe Group’s treasury management policies are designed to ensure continuity of funding. DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)\\nForeign currency risk\\nThe Group does not have any foreign currency exposure. Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities\\nAll financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling. These facilities are available to the Group until 20 December 2016. Further details of the facilities are set out in note 12 of these \\nfinancial statements. Fair values\\nThere is not considered to be any material difference between the fair value of any financial instruments \\nand their net book amount due to the short term maturity of the instruments. 20. Transactions with key management personnel \\nDirectors of the Company and their immediate relatives control approximately 23% of the voting shares of \\nthe Company. No amounts were owed to these \\ncompanies by the Company as at 31 March 2014. The directors were fully reimbursed for the purchases and no amounts \\nwere owing to the directors by the Company as at 31 March 2014. Transactions with the associate are priced \\non an arm’s length basis. 21. The Transaction had economic effect from 1 December 2013. inputs, processes and outputs). As a result of these factors the acquisition of the Companies has been accounted for as an acquisition of \\nassets rather than as business combinations.',\n",
       " ' We are making a significant contribution\\nto the regeneration of the area\\nsurrounding Docklands and the City. Our success is clear evidence of\\ntheir efforts. Increasingly our business involves building\\nmixed developments. In addition we have one\\ndevelopment in Chelmsford town centre. Gale Street consists of 11 private\\napartments. Purchasers have generally been investment\\nbuyers who either sell-on or hold the flat\\nfor letting purposes. The second is a redundant warehouse,\\naccessed from the A13, and bordering\\nthe Regents Canal at its entrance into the\\nLimehouse Basin. Our current development capacity will\\nallow us cautiously to expand the\\nbusiness and produce further growth. John has excellent experience in\\ncomplex residential construction and\\nwill be a key member of the executive\\nteam. The scheme will include diverting\\nthe towpath around a marina\\nwithin the development and past a\\nwaterfront restaurant. The local authority resolved to\\ngrant planning consent on 14th\\nMay 2003. There are several development launches\\ndue in the coming months and interest\\nfor these sites is already very encouraging. Telford Homes is now\\nwell placed to produce another year of\\nwell-managed growth as the business\\ncontinues to develop. Our operating margin has improved to\\n19.6% from 19.2%. Interest\\nInterest paid was £0.7 million compared\\nwith £0.4 million in our first 16 months. Our return\\non average total capital has also increased\\nto 20.4% from 18.2%. Taxation\\nThe effective tax charge remains\\napproximately 30%. Dividends\\nThe Company paid an interim dividend of\\n1.0p per share in January 2003. A final\\ndividend of a further 2.0p is now proposed\\nmaking a total for the year of 3.0p\\nagainst a final dividend last year of 1.0p. Earnings per share\\nEarnings per share increased to 12.7p\\nfrom 10.1p. The weighted average\\nnumber of shares in issue increased from\\n9.3 million to 23.6 million. Our asset base has been expanded and\\nwe now hold total assets of £38.9 million\\nincreased from £19.9 million. We have now finished work on six\\ndevelopments in total with a further four\\ndue to be completed in the next few weeks. Our combined overdraft facility now\\nstands at £1.5 million which gives us\\nsignificant short-term flexibility. We are\\nnot currently using this facility. Gearing at 31st March 2003 stands at\\n126% down from 138% last year. Cash flow\\nCash flows are carefully monitored and\\ncontinuously re-assessed to ensure that\\nthe continuing growth of the business can\\nbe financed by a combination of equity\\nand debt.

The board is aware of the Higgs report on corporate governance\\nand will monitor its progress. Management information systems are in place to enable the directors to make informed\\ndecisions to properly discharge their duties. This enables the\\nshareholders to decide on the election of their Company’s board. The directors are\\nresponsible for preparing the financial statements as set out in the statement of\\ndirectors’ responsibilities. The responsibilities of the auditors are set out in their report. Relations with shareholders\\nThe Company has institutional shareholders and is, where practicable, willing to enter\\ninto a dialogue with them. All board\\nmembers present at the AGM are available to answer questions from shareholders. Monthly\\nprogress on site developments is formally monitored by the board. The committee makes recommendations to the\\nboard on executive directors’ service agreements and remuneration. In doing so it has\\nundertaken relevant research to ensure that remuneration levels are competitive with\\nthe industry average. The committee met twice during the year. To add further incentive the directors\\nhave adopted two bonus schemes, one applicable to all staff and a further scheme for\\nexecutive directors. Both schemes are dependent on the Company meeting certain\\nfinancial performance targets. Service contracts\\nThe executive directors have service contracts that can be terminated on 12 months\\nnotice. These provide for termination payments equivalent to 12 months basic salary\\nand contractual benefits. The non-executive directors have letters of appointment that can be terminated on 3\\nmonths notice. This payment was approved by the\\nremuneration committee. On that date the market value of\\nthe shares was 77p. Mark Duffield was appointed to the board on 5th April 2002. Jonathan Di-Stefano and Sheena Ellwood were appointed to the board on 2nd\\nJanuary 2003. Both retire at the next annual general meeting and, being eligible, offer\\nthemselves for re-election. Creditors\\nIt is Company policy to settle all debts with its creditors on a timely basis. Employees\\nThe Company places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and\\nkeeps them informed of all relevant matters on a regular basis. Telford Homes is an\\nequal opportunities employer and all applications for employment are considered\\nfully on the basis of suitability for the job. Charitable donations\\nThe Company made charitable donations of £3,400 (2002 - £nil). The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with\\nreasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them\\nto ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements\\nand United Kingdom Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities do not extend\\nto any other information. Basis of audit opinion\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices\\nBoard. In forming our opinion\\nwe also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements. All activities are in respect of continuing operations. They have all been applied consistently throughout the\\nyear and the preceding period. Accounting convention\\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with\\napplicable accounting standards. All turnover is generated in\\nthe United Kingdom. Until there is\\nreasonable certainty over the final outcome of a development the profit is restricted to the non-refundable\\ndeposits received. Losses are provided for as soon as foreseen. Development properties\\nDevelopment properties are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Tangible fixed assets and depreciation\\nTangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Finance leases and hire purchase contracts\\nAssets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and depreciated over the shorter of\\ntheir expected useful lives and the lease term. Operating leases\\nOperating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred. Interest is payable at rates up to 2.75% over base rate. Details of facilities are given in note 21. All shares rank equally in respect of shareholder rights. In the opinion of the directors the rental is at a market rate. The directors are of the opinion that\\nthese sales were made at market prices. There is no individual controlling party. Subsequent\\nto the year end these facilities have increased to £1.5 million.

       " \" Despite the\\nsuccess to date the Board must remain cautious\\nof an increase in the rate of failed contracts. The\\nsuccess of this strategy in the past has meant\\nthat the Group has had relatively few properties\\navailable for sale over the past twelve months. The third phase including 95 open\\nmarket homes will not be build complete until the\\nsecond half of 2010. The general problems experienced in securing\\nmortgages are illustrated by statistics for the\\nnumber of mortgage approvals for house\\npurchases in 2008. Since\\nthen there has been some improvement in these\\nstatistics with the number of approvals reaching\\n39,000 in March 2009. The Group will rescind contracts on properties\\nwhere its customers are unable to complete \\nthe purchase, retaining the 10 per cent deposit\\nalready paid. These plans include\\ntemporarily securing tenants for the properties\\nbefore reselling them into an orderly market. The grants will\\npart finance over 400 affordable homes over \\nthe next three years. The Group has also\\nagreed terms to construct 64 affordable homes\\nfor Poplar HARCA in Lanrick Road, E14. Construction of the affordable homes is now\\nunderway and as such the Group has drawn \\nits first grant tranche from the HCA. These\\ninclude 193 homes on the St George’s Estate,\\n236 homes on the Bede Estate and 209 homes\\non the Holland Estate. The quality of the finished product continues \\nto be ensured by the work of the Telford Homes\\nCustomer Service team that provide quality\\ncontrol and give a consistent ‘face’ to customers. The delivery of a first rate home is a fundamental\\nstep in the completion process. This will partly be utilised as payment\\nfor land purchased from the Group’s development\\npartners. East London will be at the forefront of\\nincreasing the supply of new homes in London \\nas regeneration of the area continues. The Board believes the business is now in a\\nstrong position and is well placed to benefit from\\na future improvement in market conditions. Further\\ndetails are provided in note 21. Both of these factors will\\nresult in a lower reported margin in the future. Selling expenses are down\\nsignificantly, falling by 41 per cent, in keeping with\\nreduced sales and marketing activity in the last\\ntwelve months. Exceptional items\\nThe exceptional items reported in the year to 31st\\nMarch 2009 are primarily write downs to the value\\nof land and work in progress across a number of\\nsites totalling £2.9 million along with £0.1 million in\\nrelation to redundancy costs. The write downs\\nrepresent less than two per cent of the value of\\ninventories. Interest\\nTotal interest paid in the year was £6.4 million\\nreduced from £7.4 million last year. Prior \\nto refinancing the majority of the Group’s loans\\nwere linked to the base rate. Interest received in the year was £0.2 million,\\ndown from £0.5 million last year as a result of\\nlower interest rates on deposits. All bank facilities have been extended, renewed \\nor refinanced over the last few months. Going\\nforward interest will be charged on the Group’s\\nfacilities at base rate plus a margin of between\\n2.5% and 4.0% or LIBOR plus a margin of between\\n2.0% and 3.0%. Loan\\nfacilities are in place with three banks and are\\nsecured by debentures and by charges over\\ndevelopment sites. These facilities\\nwere renegotiated in April 2009. The facilities expire on different dates\\ndepending on the specific circumstances of\\neach development and are normally repayable\\non build completion of each development from\\nthe sales proceeds received. These facilities\\nalso expire on different dates depending on the\\nspecific circumstances of each development. This facility is due for\\nrepayment in December 2011.\\nbusiness & financial review\\n90\\n0\\n100\\n110\\n120\\n130\\nMay 09\\nApr 09\\nMar 09\\nFeb 09\\nJan 09\\nDec 08\\nNov 08\\nOct 08\\nSep 08\\nAug 08\\nJul 08\\nJun 08\\nMay 08\\nApr 08\\nMar 08\\nTotal borrowings in £ million by month\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:03  Page 17 Icona E15\\n19     Telford Homes Plc 2009\\nfinancial review continued\\nIcona E15\\nTelford RA Text  15/6/09  18:03  Page 18 Finally the Group has site specific loan facilities\\nwith Barclays Bank totalling £12.6 million in\\nrespect of certain development sites again\\nrenegotiated in April 2009. The facilities are due for repayment\\nbetween June 2010 and September 2010. In all of these cases the loans are expected to\\nbe repaid by the date the facility expires. Some of the Group's bank facilities are subject \\nto a number of general and financial covenants\\nwhich are tested periodically by each bank. In \\nall cases the Board have assessed whether the\\nGroup will remain in compliance with the\\ncovenants in the short to medium term and \\nare satisfied that there will be no breach of the\\ncovenants that cannot be easily rectified. Borrowings at 31st March 2009 were £112.0 million\\n(2008 - £101.4 million) with gearing at 206.6% (2008\\n- 191.5%). This is a\\nprudent approach reflecting the uncertain\\ntiming of completion proceeds. The Board will\\ncontinue to monitor performance with a view \\nto re-instating a dividend as soon as the Board\\nconsiders it prudent to do so. Cash flow\\nControl of cash remains of critical importance \\nand we maintain a detailed month by month \\ncash flow forecast as part of our management\\ninformation systems. The forecasts\\nare necessarily subject to a number of assumptions\\nand judgements and these are tested on \\na reasonable basis by the sensitivity analysis. These forecasts and the related sensitivity analysis\\nare reviewed by the Board in detail on a monthly\\nbasis. In addition all of the forecasts and supporting\\ncalculations are made available to each bank\\non a monthly basis. Examples\\ninclude the extension of the East\\nLondon line, improvements to the\\nDocklands Light Railway and, further\\ninto the future, the Crossrail project. Each division\\npredominantly specialises in certain sizes of\\ndevelopment and styles of construction. Alto are\\nresponsible for over 1,700 of the properties in\\nplanning, design and construction across 10\\ndevelopments and Metro are responsible for \\nover 900 properties across 20 developments. Mark Parker is responsible for\\nMetro and John Fitzgerald is responsible for Alto\\nand each division has a management team\\nresponsible for day to day operations. All of these are outside of the Group’s control. This land needs to be sourced in appropriate locations and where\\noptimum planning consents can be obtained. Planning process\\nThe flow of properties through the development pipeline is dependent on achieving suitable planning\\npermission on sites purchased without planning or subject to planning. The process is time consuming\\nand involves an increasing number of supporting reports and detailed consultations with many different\\nbodies. Early consultations with the planning authorities are a key part of the land acquisition\\nprocess. While this cannot remove planning risks it mitigates them as much as possible. Health and Safety\\nConstruction sites are dangerous places and there are many different health and safety risks to consider. The quality of the construction work and finish in each\\nproperty affects the reputation of the Group and can impact on repeat purchase and\\nrecommendation rates. Standards of construction and control of the building process on site are of paramount importance to each\\noperating division. The construction teams work very\\nclosely with the Customer Service team and their interaction commences at an early stage in the\\ndevelopment. Availability of materials and labour\\nThe availability of materials and sub-contracted labour for each site can affect both the construction\\nprogramme and the cost of construction. Build cost inflation will impact directly on the margin\\nachieved on each site where this is in excess of forecasts. The tender process ensures that competitive rates are achieved on every trade. Forecasting\\nof cash flows is critical to ensure the Group is not operating beyond its financial capacity. This extends five years into the future and is subject to continual re-assessment and sensitivity analysis. Political environment\\nChanges in laws and regulations can have a direct impact on the efficient running of the Group and\\nthe costs incurred on each development. Changes in both local and national government can have\\na direct bearing on the regulatory environment. We invest in the training and development of our\\npeople with the continuation of our ‘Health and\\nSafety Core’ training programme. We are pleased to announce that Telford Homes\\nreceived ‘Silver Awards’ for both the ‘Health and\\nSafety Achievement Award’ and ‘Management\\nof Occupational Road Risk’. These awards are \\na fantastic achievement for us and show how\\nadvanced we are in our management of health\\nand safety. The Silver Awards are a great start\\nand I am confident that next year we should be\\nable to go one better. On most of our projects we operate the\\nConsiderate Constructors Scheme and we are\\nmonitored regularly against performance criteria. This forum monitors ‘trend\\nanalysis’ covering the results of site by site health\\nand safety inspections. This helps our site managers\\nand senior management team to make continual\\nimprovements in the standards of health and\\nsafety on site. The publication is seen as a subtle\\nand effective means of communication to\\ncontinually stimulate discussion and keep health\\nand safety in the forefront of people’s minds. Our ‘supply-chain’ procedure is now fully\\ndeveloped with the vast majority of our suppliers\\nnow vetted by our health and safety department. The procedure for prohibiting the placing of orders\\nwith suppliers that have not been successfully\\nvetted remains in place. I am generally satisfied with the high health and\\nsafety standards across the Group but I am also\\nconsciously aware that we cannot rest on our\\nlaurels. I remain confident that we not only\\nhave the right procedures in place but more\\nimportantly have the right people to deliver the\\nresults we expect. The Group has an environmental policy and we\\nensure that this is communicated throughout \\nour operations. Where waste is unavoidable, \\nwe endeavour to recycle and re-use it in our\\nprojects before sending it off to landfill. The Site\\nWaste Management Plan Regulations 2008\\nwhich came into force on the 1st April 2008\\nsignified a stepped change in how waste is\\nmanaged in the industry. Each site now requires \\na Site Waste Management Plan to be in place,\\ndetailing measures as to how it intends to\\nmanage its waste. These are just a few of the things that Telford Homes\\nis doing and all of these initiatives are having \\na positive impact now and will continue to do \\nso in the future. Both are housing transfer organisations and\\nsignificant land owners in East London. Telford Homes is continuing to progress master\\nplans for the regeneration of five other estates\\nwith Eastend Homes and we expect to commence\\nconstruction on the Bede Estate, E3, in\\nautumn 2009. In 1997 David held the\\nannual position of President of the House Builders Federation. David is currently Chairman of Orchid\\nDevelopments Group Ltd and non-executive director of the Harpenden Building Society. He chairs the remuneration committee and is\\na member of the audit committee. Prior to 1990 his experience had been gained in various sectors, including seven years\\nwith B.A.T Industries. David had been Group Managing Director since the start of\\nthe Company’s operations in 2001. He had one year with\\nMothercare following five years with Arthur Andersen. Apart from financial matters Jon also has\\nboard responsibility for personnel issues. There has been extensive growth in both areas and Jon has\\ndeveloped a significant finance team. Sheena Ellwood BA (Hons), Dip. Int. Marketing, Sales & Marketing Director, 50\\nSheena Ellwood joined Telford Homes Plc as Sales & Marketing Director in January 2003. He is currently Deputy Chairman of RO Group. Robert is chairman of the audit\\ncommittee and a member of the remuneration committee. He is also a member of the audit\\ncommittee of the Church Commissioners and of the Royal Shakespeare Company. John was appointed a\\ndirector on the 1st August 2007 and is the director with responsibility for health and safety. These policies are monitored to\\nensure that they are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and comply as far as possible with the\\nprovisions of the Code given the size of the Group. There are nine directors in total of \\nwhom two are non-executive directors. The\\nBoard meets once a month and the directors make every effort to attend all board meetings. The Board is responsible for taking all major strategic decisions and also addressing any significant\\noperational matters. Management information systems are in place to\\nenable the directors to make informed decisions to properly discharge their duties. The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separate. The Chairman is responsible for running\\nthe Board and he meets regularly and separately with the Chief Executive and the other non-executive\\ndirector to discuss matters for the Board. One third of the\\ndirectors retire annually in rotation in accordance with the Company’s articles of association. This\\nenables the shareholders to decide on the election of the Company’s Board. The directors are responsible for preparing the financial\\nstatements as set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. The responsibilities of the auditors\\nare set out in their report. Remuneration committee\\nDetails concerning the composition and meetings of the remuneration committee are contained in\\nthe directors’ remuneration report on pages 43 to 44. The non-\\nexecutive directors meet separately with the auditors once a year. The committee has a responsibility for reviewing the financial statements provided to shareholders. In\\naddition the committee reviews the business and financial risks and internal controls as described below. The Chief Executive and the Financial Director meet regularly with institutional investors\\nwithin the confines of relevant legislation and guidance. The Board invites communication from its private investors and encourages participation by them at the\\nAnnual General Meeting (AGM). All Board members present at the AGM are available to answer questions\\nfrom shareholders. Internal control\\nThe Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board\\nformally monitors monthly progress on each development. Composition of the remuneration committee\\nThe remuneration committee comprises the independent non-executive directors, David Holland and Robert\\nClarke. The committee makes recommendations to the Board on executive directors’ service agreements\\nand remuneration. In doing so it has undertaken relevant research to ensure that remuneration levels are\\ncompetitive with the industry average. The committee met twice during the year. To add further incentive the directors have adopted two bonus schemes,\\none applicable to all staff and a scheme for executive directors and senior management. Both schemes\\nare dependent on the Group meeting certain financial performance targets. The maximum amount that\\ncan be earned under the executive bonus scheme is 100% of basic salary. Further details are given in note 17 to the financial statements. The\\nremuneration committee is responsible for approving any offers of shares made under the DPSPP. The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors after considering\\nexternal market research. They do not participate in the bonus schemes or in the personal pension\\nscheme. They are entitled to participate in the SIP. Service contracts\\nThe executive directors have service contracts that can be terminated on twelve months notice. These\\nprovide for termination payments equivalent to twelve months basic salary and contractual benefits. The non-executive directors have letters of appointment that can be terminated on three months notice. The primary key performance indicators are disclosed on page 1. No interim dividend was paid in respect of the year ended 31st March 2009 and the directors\\nrecommend that no final dividend be paid. Accordingly the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual\\nreport and accounts. All shares purchased under the SIP are matched\\nby shares provided by the Company on a one for one basis. Further details on the SIP are included in note 17 to the financial statements. Investment in own shares\\nThe Company’s investment in own shares relates solely to the Share Incentive Plan and further details\\nof the total holding and movements in the holding are disclosed in note 17. Creditors\\nIt is Group policy to settle all debts with its creditors on a timely basis. Subcontractors are paid upon\\nagreement of the value of works completed based on their applications for payment and the terms\\nagreed. In general, other suppliers are paid during the month following the month of receipt of the\\ninvoice unless other terms have been specifically agreed. Telford Homes is an equal opportunities employer and all\\napplications for employment are considered fully on the basis of suitability for the job. Charitable donations\\nThe Group made charitable donations of £15,000 (2008 - £17,000). These donations were made to a\\nnumber of different charities supporting a broad range of good causes. Auditors\\nA resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the Company will be proposed\\nat the Annual General Meeting in accordance with section 385 of the Companies Act 1985. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The financial statements are\\nrequired by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss \\nof the Group for that period. The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the\\nfinancial statements. The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable\\naccuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial\\nstatements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets\\nof the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and\\nother irregularities. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in\\nthe United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ\\nfrom legislation in other jurisdictions. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory\\nrequirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also report to you whether in\\nour opinion the information given in the report of the directors is consistent with the financial statements. We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the\\naudited financial statements. We consider the implications for\\nour report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the\\nfinancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to\\nthe amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in\\nthe financial statements. (b) Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial\\nstatements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. Although these estimates are based on the directors best knowledge of the\\namounts, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently for all periods presented in\\nthese financial statements except where the Group has taken the option to early adopt IFRIC 15\\n'Agreements for the construction of real estate' and IAS 23 (revised) 'Borrowing costs' from 1st April\\n2008. The prior year comparatives have been restated and further information is given in note 21. All intra-group\\ntransactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Exemptions\\nThe directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 230 of the Companies\\nAct 1985 and have not presented an income statement for the Company alone. Jointly controlled entities\\nA jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds an interest with one or more other\\nparties where a contractual arrangement has established joint control over the entity. Jointly\\ncontrolled entities are accounted for using proportional consolidation. Segmental reporting\\nThe Group has only one business segment being housebuilding and one geographical segment being\\nthe United Kingdom. Revenue and profit recognition\\nProperties for open market sale\\nRevenue and profit is recognised at the point of legal completion of each property. Construction contracts\\nContracts are treated as construction contracts when they have been specifically negotiated for the\\nconstruction of a development or a number of properties. These contracts are primarily for the\\nconstruction of affordable homes. Revenue is only recognised on a construction contract where the\\noutcome can be estimated reliably. Revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of\\ncompletion of contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by an\\nassessment of work performed to date. Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is\\nrecognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. When it is\\nprobable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised\\nas an expense immediately. Selling expenses\\nSelling expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred. Borrowings\\nInterest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. All other borrowing costs are charged to the income statement using the effective interest method. Exceptional items\\nExceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or\\nincidence to enable a full understanding of the Group's financial performance. Finance leases and hire purchase contracts\\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the\\nrisks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease or hire\\npurchase obligation. Finance charges are charged to the income statement. Operating leases\\nOperating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of\\nthe lease. Property, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Inventories\\nDevelopment properties are included in inventories and are stated at the lower of cost and net\\nrealisable value. Cost comprises costs of acquisition and development, including directly attributable\\nfees and expenses, direct labour costs and borrowing costs. These are held for future sale. Financial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group's balance sheet when the Group\\nbecomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument. Borrowings\\nInterest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. Trade payables\\nTrade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. Fair value is\\ndetermined by using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities and equity instruments\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual\\narrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in\\nthe assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are\\nrecorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Taxation\\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on the profits for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit \\nas reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are tax\\ndeductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The\\nGroup's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively\\nenacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not\\nreversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay\\nmore tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged\\nor credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. With respect to share-based payments, a deferred tax asset is recognised on the relevant tax base. The tax base is then compared to the cumulative share-based payment expense recognised in the\\nincome statement. Contract profit on\\nconstruction contracts is recognised in proportion to revenue only to the extent that the total\\neventual profit on the contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Recognition of profit also involves estimation of the \\ntotal expected revenues from each contract and therefore the expected profit margin that will be\\nachieved. Judgement is required to assess whether the total eventual profit on each contract can \\nbe foreseen with reasonable certainty. Carrying value of land and work in progress\\nInventories include land and work in progress in respect of development sites. In some cases land is\\nheld awaiting a planning consent. At the date of the authorisation of these financial statements, there are a number of standards,\\namendments and interpretations that have been published. This amendment prohibits the presentation of\\nitems of income and expense (that is 'non-owner changes in equity') in the statement of changes in\\nequity. Revised IAS 1 also sets out the additional disclosure requirements for entities making restatements\\nor reclassifications. It will apply to the Group from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009. IFRS 2 (Amendment) 'Share-based payment'. This amendment clarifies that vesting conditions are\\nservice and performance conditions only. It also specifies that all cancellations should receive the\\nsame accounting treatment, whether cancelled by the entity or by other parties. The amendment \\nwill apply to the Group from the annual period commencing 1st April 2009. This standard includes some significant changes to how the acquisition\\nmethod is applied to business combinations. IFRS 7 (Amendment) 'Financial instruments: Disclosures'. This amendment increases the disclosure\\nrequirements for fair value measurement. It will apply to the Group from the annual period\\ncommencing 1st April 2009. The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions\\nwith non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control. Reconciliation of effective tax rate\\nThe tax assessed for the year is higher (2008 - higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the\\nUK of 28% (2008 - 30%). All deferred tax\\nassets and liabilities are now recognised at 28%. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of\\nordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. A full list of subsidiary undertakings is available on request from the Group's registered office. The operating cycle is such that a proportion \\nof inventories will not be realised within twelve months. The\\ntotal amount recognised as an expense within exceptional items was £2,868,000. Details of own shares held within employee benefit trusts are disclosed in note 17. All shares rank equally in respect of shareholder rights. Awards under each scheme are made periodically to new employees. All schemes are\\nequity-settled and options can normally be exercised three years after the grant date. This charge is calculated at the date\\nof grant of the options and is charged equally over the vesting period. The corresponding adjustment\\nto equity is made directly to the profit and loss reserve. The Group has used the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to calculate the fair value of outstanding\\noptions. Individual calculations have been performed for groups of share options with differing\\nexercise prices and dates. Volatility\\nin more recent years is considered to have more relevance than earlier years for the period reviewed. No share options were exercised in the year ended 31st March 2009.\\n. This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and\\nconfers certain tax advantages for participating employees. The SIP provides for employees to purchase shares up to a value of £1,500 in each tax year. These\\nshares are known as 'Partnership shares'. Dividends are paid on both Partnership and Matching shares and these are\\nallocated to employees as 'Dividend shares'. The costs associated with the trust are paid for by the Group\\nand the Group finances all share purchases. The trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating\\nin the scheme. These shares remain in the trust until such time as an employee withdraws from the SIP. Further shares have been allocated to employees as Matching shares and the cost of these shares is\\nbeing written off over the three year holding period. Shares held by the SIP are recognised as a deduction from shareholders’ funds. Movements in the profit and loss reserve\\nrelating to the SIP are shown in the statement of changes in equity. This loan is interest free repayable on or before the\\nrepayment date which is normally ten years from the date of the loan or on leaving employment or\\ndisposing of the shares. The loan has a limited recourse such that repayment is limited to the value of the\\nshares on the repayment date. The Group will lend the trustee sufficient funds to enable the trustee to\\nprovide the loans to individual participants. Offers to participants\\nwill be made periodically at the discretion of the directors of Telford Homes Plc. In September 2006 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 550,000 shares at the\\nmarket value of 260p. These shares were issued on 9th November 2006. On this date the Group provided\\na loan to the trustee of £1,430,000 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. In December 2007 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 160,000 shares at the\\nmarket value of 244p. These shares were issued on 14th December 2007. On this date the Group provided\\na loan to the trustee of £390,400 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. In July 2006 David Holland purchased an apartment from the Group at the OneStratford\\ndevelopment. Subsequently contracts were exchanged on 11th December 2006 for a parking space\\nat the same development. The combined purchase price was £262,500. The purchase was approved at a previous Extraordinary General Meeting. There have been no other transactions between key management personnel and the Group apart\\nfrom that referred to above. Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been\\neliminated on consolidation. All other trade and other\\nreceivables and trade payables are due within one year. All land\\ncreditors are due within one year. The facilities expire on different dates depending on the\\nspecific circumstances of each development and are normally repayable on completion of each\\ndevelopment from the sales proceeds received. Of the utilised loans of £21.2 million, none is due for\\nrepayment within one year, £6.5 million is due for repayment after more than one year and less than\\ntwo years and £14.7 million is due for repayment after more than two years and less than five years. The facilities expire on different dates depending\\non the specific circumstances of each development and are normally repayable on completion of\\neach development from the sales proceeds received. Of the utilised loans of £62.2 million, £43.3\\nmillion is due for repayment within one year, £16.0 million is due for repayment after more than one\\nyear and less than two years and £2.9 million is due for repayment after more than two years and less\\nthan five years. This facility is due for repayment in\\nDecember 2011. The facilities are due for repayment between June 2010 and\\nSeptember 2010. Interest is charged on all of the Group's facilities at either base rate plus a margin of between 2.5%\\nand 4.0% or LIBOR plus a margin of between 2.0% and 3.0%. Interest on all facilities currently held is charged at floating interest rates and the\\nGroup assesses the requirement for fixing interest rates on a regular basis. The effect on the income statement of a 1% rise and a 1% fall in interest rates has been calculated to\\nassess interest rate sensitivity. The Group considers its\\ncapital to be all of the components of net assets. Credit risk\\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations. The Group considers the credit quality\\nof the various debtors to be good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is\\nconsidered to be low. Surplus cash is held in secure bank deposit accounts with Allied Irish Bank, The Royal Bank of Scotland\\nand Barclays Bank. Liquidity risk\\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its\\nobligations as they fall due. The forecasts are necessarily\\nsubject to a number of assumptions and judgements and these are tested on a reasonable basis by\\nthe sensitivity analysis. These forecasts and the related sensitivity analysis are reviewed by the directors\\nin detail on a monthly basis. In addition all of the forecasts and supporting calculations are made\\navailable to each bank funding the Group on a monthly basis. In all of these cases the directors are\\nsatisfied that the loans are expected to be repaid by the date the facility expires. The guidance in the existing standards allows flexibility in the accounting\\ntreatment that should be adopted. The accounting treatment for affordable\\nhomes is therefore unaffected by IFRIC 15. These selling expenses are charged after gross profit but\\nwithin operating profit. Qualifying assets are\\nthose that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale. Each development undertaken by the Group represents a qualifying asset under IAS 23 (revised) due\\nto the period of time taken in obtaining planning consent and completing construction on the site. Each development typically has site specific finance and therefore borrowing costs can be directly\\nattributed to each site. The only changes required to cash flow statements previously reported are presentational. Other selling expenses are now\\nwritten off as incurred increasing total expenses by a further £2.3 million. Remaining finance costs relate to non development specific costs and bank\\ninterest on developments where capitalisation has been suspended. Profit before income tax is reduced from £17.7 million to £6.5 million. The income tax expense is\\nrestated by 30 percent of the net impact on profit before income tax. An element of receivables then become payable\\nbalances primarily representing deposits received in advance and are reclassified as such. FARRINGDON ST\\nWATERLOO RD.

       " \" Ongoing regeneration is improving the \\nquality of the built environment for the benefit \\nof both existing and new residents. Poplar \\nHARCA was our partner in developing 64 \\naffordable homes at lanrick Road. It is a great credit to T elford Homes that \\nthese three major banks are prepared to \\nsupport the business to this extent. Overseas sales\\nOverseas launches including \\nMatchmakers Wharf, the Hawksmoors \\nand Avant-garde have been very \\nsuccessful. Jon replaces \\nAndrew Wiseman and I am confident that \\nTelford Homes will continue to prosper under \\nhis leadership. I have been delighted to serve \\nas Chairman over a successful decade and I \\nlook forward to continuing as a Non-Executive \\nDirector in the future. Overall sales \\nperformance has been better than expected due to the \\nsuccessful off-plan marketing of developments that are \\ndue to be finished between mid-2012 and mid-2014. Whilst there \\nhave been some signs of improvement in the number \\nof mortgages available, the Council of Mortgage \\nLenders expects gross lending for housing to be \\nunchanged in 2011. Construction is underway and handovers  \\nwill take place from late 2013 onwards. This provides the Group with equity to be \\nused for further site acquisitions and the repayment of \\ndebt. The Group will continue to market appropriate \\ndevelopments overseas to secure revenue that will  \\nbe recognised on legal completions in future years. New opportunities are \\nappraised on a conditional basis until the value and \\namount of affordable housing required is clear. This will only partially substitute for the \\nreduction in government funding and therefore less \\naffordable housing will be built. Telford Homes is working with several landowners to \\nsecure planning for developments that are not yet \\nunder the Group’s control. Operations\\nFew developers possess the expertise and experience \\nof Telford Homes in East London. At that time I will take on \\nspecial responsibility for land acquisition alongside the \\nnormal responsibilities of the Chairman. She has \\nbeen instrumental in securing the new banking facility \\nand is well known to the Group’s bankers. The \\nlonger term prospects for Telford Homes remain strong. Selling expenses have increased by 42  \\nper cent to £2.7 million (2010: £1.9 million) in line with \\nthe increase in the number of contracts exchanged  \\nin the year. Exceptional items\\nOn 17 September 2010 the Group acquired the other 50 per \\ncent of Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited, the joint venture \\nset up to develop Greenwich Creekside, from The Royal \\nBank of Scotland. Their interest was acquired for the sum  \\nof £500 with all existing equity injected by the bank being \\nconverted to debt. For the first time the Board has agreed to take  \\nout some protection against future interest rates. The cost of this cap was £290,000 paid up front and \\nthis will be expensed over the term of the product. The final dividend is expected to be paid on  \\n22 July\\xa02011 to those shareholders on the register  \\nat the close of business on 24 June 2011. This balance includes operational balances  \\nof £12.7 million and grant monies held for future \\nexpenditure of £6.1 million. The rate of \\nsales being secured resulted in the Board concluding \\nthat the funding was no longer required. Cash management and cash flow \\nforecasting\\nControl of cash remains important and a detailed \\nmonth-by-month cash flow forecast is maintained as \\npart of the Group’s management information systems. The forecasts \\nare necessarily subject to a number of assumptions and \\njudgements and these are tested on a reasonable basis \\nby sensitivity analysis. These forecasts are reviewed by \\nthe Board in detail on a monthly basis. Interest will be charged on the new facility at 3.5 per \\ncent over LIBOR with an arrangement fee of 1.25 per \\ncent payable in two tranches. The first ten per cent of any deposits \\nreceived can be retained by the Group without any \\nloan repayment. To date \\n£18.3 million of the first phase debt has been repaid. William Pears purchased a 50 per cent \\ninterest from Genesis Housing Group at cost. Each division predominantly specialises in certain sizes \\nof development and styles of construction. Mark Parker is responsible for Metro and John Fitzgerald is \\nresponsible for Alto and each division has a management \\nteam responsible for day-to-day operations. The Group also operates a comprehensive Management \\nTrainee programme under which trainees from school \\nor college are employed annually. Trainees are taken \\non in each of the operational departments and are \\noften based on site. A \\ncombination of college based training and on the  \\njob training alongside experienced staff allows the \\napprentices and trainees to develop technical as  \\nwell as personal skills. The Group puts training at the heart of its  \\noperations ensuring its employees maintain their \\nindustry knowledge. We invest in the training and development of our people \\nwith the continuation of our ‘Health and Safety Core’ \\ntraining programme. We \\ndemand that our suppliers employ competent people and \\nencourage continual professional development of those \\nholding safety critical posts. To support this process we \\nhave established and held subsidised onsite training \\nspecifically for their employees. Our accident frequency rate for the year to \\n31\\xa0March\\xa02011 was in line with the industry average. In an attempt to improve this situation  \\nwe have instigated a programme of simple solutions  \\nto make people consciously aware of themselves \\nand their interaction with their workplace. The RoSPA \\nawards and the BSI certification recognise the maturity of \\nour occupational health and safety management system \\nand the culture of the Company. Our ‘supply-chain’ procedure remains in place with all of our \\nsuppliers vetted by the health and safety department. In a \\nclimate where businesses are cautious and resources are \\nunder pressure several of our suppliers have struggled and \\nsome have ceased trading. As part of our vetting procedure \\nthe commercial viability of each supplier is scrutinised in an\\nattempt to ensure they are able to meet their obligations. We continually monitor \\nour suppliers and take the necessary steps to ensure they \\nmeet our high expectations. John Fitzgerald and Mark Parker remain responsible \\nfor health and safety in each of the operating divisions \\nand John Fitzgerald is the board member with overall \\nresponsibility for health and safety. The \\nGroup has an environmental policy and we ensure that \\nthis is communicated throughout our operations. Our \\nenvironmental policy and environmental management \\nsystem is regularly reviewed to ensure the prevention  \\nof pollution and compliance with relevant legislation. We have commenced the accreditation process  \\nwith the British Standards Institute to certify our \\nenvironmental management system to BS EN ISO \\n14001:2004. The materials used in our developments  \\ncontribute to our environmental performance. We have adopted the Building Research Establishment \\nSMARTER\\n©\\n Waste programme which not only  \\nrecords waste but also energy & timber usage. In \\naddition we use both established and cutting edge \\ntechnologies to improve the energy efficiency of our \\ndevelopments once they are occupied. Biomass plant is currently being used or will be  \\nused at Greenwich Creekside, OneStratford, SoBow, \\nAvant-garde, Matchmakers Wharf, Bow Trinity,  \\nVellum and Lanrick Road. The same heat passes \\nthrough a heat exchanger to generate domestic \\nheating and hot water for a communal system. A CHP is being incorporated at Avant-garde and is \\nbeing considered for future developments. Accreditation \\nprocess begun\\nwith the British Standards institute  \\nto certify our environmental \\nmanagement system to  \\nBS EN iSO 14001:2004. Current \\ninnovations in PV include solar tiles and transparent \\npanels for incorporation into walls. PV panels are installed or will be installed at Stadthaus, \\nBow Trinity, St Anne’s, St George’s Estate, Trades Hall \\nin Leyton and High Cedars in Wanstead. Solar thermal\\nSolar thermal panel heaters use radiant energy  \\nfrom the sun to heat water. There are two types of \\ncollectors for solar heating - flat plate and evacuated \\ntube. The collectors are connected to the plumbing \\nsystem of individual apartments and complement a \\nhigh efficiency boiler to deliver domestic hot water  \\nand heating. This technology is in use at Stadia in Leyton  \\nand Icona in Stratford. Air source heat pumps\\nAir from within the dwelling or from outside is put \\nthrough a process of evaporation, compression, \\ncondensation and expansion via a small electric pump. This releases heat from the air that is used to raise \\nthe temperature of water for domestic use and for \\nunderfloor heating. Air source heat pumps are used or will be used  \\nat Decorum in Leyton, St Anne’s, Avant-garde  \\nand the St George’s Estate. Wind power\\nWind turbines are the most visible of all renewable \\ntechnologies. They are installed on the outside of  \\na building and turn generators in order to produce \\nelectrical energy for use in the building or for export  \\nto the national grid. A wind turbine has been installed at Kinetica and \\nanother is planned at Avant-garde. All of these are outside of the Group’s control. This land needs to be \\nsourced in appropriate locations and where optimum \\nplanning consents can be obtained. The appraisal \\nprocess that determines the price paid for land is \\ncritical in maintaining margins and return on equity  \\nat acceptable levels. Planning process\\nThe flow of properties through the development \\npipeline is dependent on achieving suitable planning \\npermission on sites purchased without planning or \\nsubject to planning. The process is time consuming \\nand involves an increasing number of supporting \\nreports and detailed consultations with many \\ndifferent bodies. Early consultations \\nwith the planning authorities are a key part of the \\nland acquisition process. While this cannot remove \\nplanning risks it mitigates them as much as \\npossible. All of the sites currently owned by  \\nthe Group have the benefit of a full planning \\npermission. Forecasting \\nof cash flows is critical to ensure the Group is not \\noperating beyond its financial capacity. This extends five years into the future \\nand is subject to continual re-assessment and \\nsensitivity analysis. Standards of construction and control of the \\nbuilding process on site are of paramount \\nimportance to each operating division. The construction teams work very \\nclosely with the Customer Service team and their \\ninteraction commences at an early stage in the \\ndevelopment. Availability of materials and labour\\nThe availability of materials and sub-contracted \\nlabour for each site can affect both the construction \\nprogramme and the cost of construction. Build cost \\ninflation will impact directly on the margin achieved  \\non each site where this is in excess of forecasts. The tender process ensures \\nthat competitive rates are achieved on every trade. Health and Safety\\nConstruction sites are dangerous places and there \\nare many different health and safety risks to consider. The health and safety of everyone associated with \\nTelford Homes, both employees and sub-contractors, \\nis the first priority of the Group. Political environment\\nChanges in laws and regulations can have a direct \\nimpact on the efficient running of the Group and  \\nthe costs incurred on each development. Changes  \\nin both local and national government can have a  \\ndirect bearing on the regulatory environment. In 1997 David held \\nthe annual position of President \\nof the House Builders Federation. He chairs the remuneration \\ncommittee and is a member  \\nof the audit committee. David had been \\nGroup Managing Director since the \\nstart of the Company’s operations \\nin 2001. Jon Di-Stefano joined Telford \\nHomes Plc as Financial Director \\nin October 2002. He had one \\nyear with Mothercare following \\nfive years with Arthur Andersen. Apart from financial matters Jon \\nalso has board responsibility \\nfor human resources. There has \\nbeen extensive growth in both \\nareas and Jon has developed a \\nsignificant finance team. Andrew spear-headed the \\nsuccessful flotation of both Furlong \\nHomes Plc and Telford Homes \\nPlc on AIM. The former on the \\nlaunch of AIM in 1995 and the \\nlatter in December 2001 building \\non excellent relationships with \\ninstitutional investors. Robert Clarke was a partner in \\nBinder Hamlyn and subsequently \\nArthur Andersen until his \\nretirement in 2000. He has \\nalso been a non-executive director \\nof various other public and \\nprivate companies and served on \\ncommittees of national charities. Robert is chairman of the audit \\ncommittee and a member of the \\nremuneration committee. John Fitzgerald began his \\ncareer in 1987 with Willmot \\nDixon Construction followed by \\nWillmot Dixon Housing. John was \\nappointed a director on 1\\xa0August \\n2007 and is the director with \\nresponsibility for health and safety \\nthroughout the business. Int. There are nine directors in total of whom two are non-executive \\ndirectors. The Board meets once a month and the directors make \\nevery effort to attend all board meetings. The Board is responsible for taking all major strategic decisions and also addressing any significant operational \\nmatters. Management information systems are in place to enable the directors to make \\ninformed decisions to properly discharge their duties. The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separate. The Chairman is responsible for running the \\nBoard and he meets regularly and separately with the Chief Executive and the other non-executive director to \\ndiscuss matters for the Board. One third of the directors retire annually in \\nrotation in accordance with the Company’s articles of association. This enables the shareholders to decide on \\nthe election of the Company’s Board. The directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements as set \\nout in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. The responsibilities of the auditors are set out in their report. r emuneration committee\\nDetails concerning the composition and meetings of the remuneration committee are contained in the directors’ \\nremuneration report on pages 36 to 37. The non-executive directors \\nmeet separately with the auditors up to twice a year. The committee has a responsibility for reviewing the financial statements provided to shareholders. The Chief Executive and the Financial Director meet regularly with institutional investors within the confines of \\nrelevant legislation and guidance. All Board members present at the AGM are available to answer questions \\nfrom shareholders. Internal control\\nThe Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board formally monitors \\nmonthly progress on each development. Composition of the remuneration committee\\nThe remuneration committee comprises the independent non-executive directors, David Holland and Robert \\nClarke. The committee makes recommendations to the Board on executive directors’ service agreements and \\nremuneration. In doing so it has undertaken relevant research to ensure that remuneration levels are competitive \\nwith the industry average. The committee met four times during the year. Both schemes are dependent on the \\nGroup meeting certain financial performance targets. The maximum amount that can be earned under the \\nexecutive bonus scheme is 100% of basic salary. Further details are given in note 17 to the financial statements. The remuneration committee \\nis responsible for approving any offers of shares made under the DPSPP. The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors after considering external \\nmarket research. They do not participate in the bonus schemes or in the personal pension scheme. They are \\nentitled to participate in the SIP. Service contracts\\nThe executive directors have service contracts that can be terminated on twelve months notice. These provide \\nfor termination payments equivalent to twelve months basic salary and contractual benefits. The non-executive directors have letters of appointment that can be terminated on three months notice. The directors believe that the Group is well \\nplaced to manage its business risks successfully. Accordingly \\nthe directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts. All shares purchased under the SIP are matched \\nby shares provided by the Company on a one for one basis. Further details on the SIP are included in note 17 to the financial statements. Further information is disclosed in note 16. Creditors\\nIt is Group policy to settle all debts with its creditors on a timely basis. Subcontractors are paid upon agreement \\nof the value of works completed based on their applications for payment and the terms agreed. In general, other \\nsuppliers are paid during the month following the month of receipt of the invoice unless other terms have been \\nspecifically agreed. Telford Homes is an equal opportunities employer and all applications \\nfor employment are considered fully on the basis of suitability for the job. Charitable donations\\nThe Group made charitable donations of £18,000 (2010: £33,000). These donations were made to a number  \\nof different charities supporting a broad range of good causes. Auditors\\nA resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the Company will be proposed at the \\nAnnual General Meeting in accordance with section 489 of the Companies Act 2006. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the \\nCompany’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and \\nthe Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are \\nalso responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps  \\nfor the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in the  \\nUnited Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  \\nin other jurisdictions. Those standards require us to comply \\nwith the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. If we become aware of any apparent material \\nmisstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. The financial statements have been prepared under \\nthe historical cost convention. The accounting policies set out below have been \\napplied consistently for all periods presented in these \\nfinancial statements. All intra-group transactions, balances, \\nincome and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Exemptions\\nThe directors have taken advantage of the exemption \\navailable under Section 408 of the Companies Act \\n2006 and have not presented an income statement for \\nthe Company alone. Jointly controlled entities\\nA jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the \\nGroup holds an interest with one or more other parties \\nwhere a contractual arrangement has established \\njoint control over the entity. Jointly controlled entities \\nare accounted for using proportional consolidation. Segmental reporting\\nThe Group has only one business segment being \\nhousebuilding and one geographical segment being \\nthe United Kingdom. Revenue and profit recognition\\nProperties for open market sale\\nRevenue and profit is recognised at the point of legal \\ncompletion of each property. Construction contracts\\nContracts are treated as construction contracts \\nwhen they have been specifically negotiated for \\nthe construction of a development or a number of \\nproperties. These contracts are primarily for the \\nconstruction of affordable homes. Revenue is only \\nrecognised on a construction contract where the \\noutcome can be estimated reliably. Revenue and \\ncosts are recognised by reference to the stage of \\ncompletion of contract activity at the balance sheet \\ndate. This is normally measured by an assessment of \\nwork performed to date. Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot \\nbe estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised \\nto the extent of contract costs incurred that it is \\nprobable will be recoverable. When it is probable that \\ntotal contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, \\nthe expected loss is recognised as an expense \\nimmediately. Selling expenses\\nSelling expenses are charged to the income statement \\nas incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing costs \\ncommences from the date of initial expenditure on a \\ngiven development and continues until the properties \\nare ready for sale. Capitalisation is not normally suspended during a \\nperiod when substantial technical and administrative \\nwork is being carried out. All other borrowing costs are charged to the income \\nstatement using the effective interest method. Exceptional items\\nExceptional items are those significant items which \\nare separately disclosed by virtue of their size or \\nincidence to enable a full understanding of the Group's \\nfinancial performance. Finance leases and hire purchase contracts\\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the \\nterms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks \\nand rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other \\nleases are classified as operating leases. The corresponding liability is included in the \\nbalance sheet as a finance lease or hire purchase \\nobligation. Finance charges are \\ncharged to the income statement. Operating leases\\nOperating lease rentals are charged to the income \\nstatement on a straight line basis over the life of \\nthe lease. Property, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less \\naccumulated depreciation. Inventories\\nDevelopment properties are included in inventories \\nand are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable \\nvalue. Cost comprises costs of acquisition and \\ndevelopment, including directly attributable fees and \\nexpenses, direct labour costs and borrowing costs. These are \\nheld for future sale. Financial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised \\non the Group's balance sheet when the Group becomes \\na party to the contractual provision of the instrument. Borrowings\\nInterest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are \\nrecorded at the proceeds received. Fair value is determined \\nby using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities and equity instruments\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are \\nclassified according to the substance of the \\ncontractual arrangements entered into. An equity \\ninstrument is any contract that evidences a residual \\ninterest in the assets of the Group after deducting  \\nall of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the \\nGroup are recorded at the proceeds received, net  \\nof direct issue costs. Taxation\\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the tax \\ncurrently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on the profits for the \\nyear. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported \\nin the income statement because it excludes items \\nof income or expense that are tax deductible in other \\nyears and it further excludes items that are never \\ntaxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current \\ntax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted \\nor substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary \\ndifferences that have originated but not reversed at \\nthe balance sheet date where transactions or events \\nthat result in an obligation to pay more tax in the \\nfuture or a right to pay less tax in the future have \\noccurred at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income \\nstatement, except when it relates to items charged or \\ncredited directly to equity, in which case the deferred \\ntax is also dealt with in equity. With respect to share-based payments, a deferred \\ntax asset is recognised on the relevant tax base. The \\ntax base is then compared to the cumulative share-\\nbased payment expense recognised in the income \\nstatement. Assessing the percentage complete on each contract \\ninvolves estimation of total expected costs to be \\nincurred until the end of the contract. Recognition of \\nprofit also involves estimation of the total expected \\nrevenues from each contract and therefore the expected \\nprofit margin that will be achieved. Judgement is \\nrequired to assess whether the total eventual profit on \\neach contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Carrying value of land and work in progress\\nInventories include land and work in progress in \\nrespect of development sites. In \\naddition IFRIC 17 and IFRIC 18 have become effective \\nfor the Group. Amendments to IFRS 2, IAS 17 and IAS 39 were made \\nas part of Annual improvements to IFRSs 2009. At the date of the authorisation of these financial \\nstatements, there are a number of standards, \\namendments and interpretations that have been \\npublished but are not yet effective. The Group is \\ncurrently assessing the applicability of these annual \\nimprovements although at present it does not \\nbelieve that they will have a material effect on the \\nGroup. y IFRS 11 ‘ Joint arrangements’ provides for a more \\nrealistic reflection of joint arrangements by focusing \\non the rights and obligations of the arrangement, \\nrather than its legal form. Proportional consolidation \\nis no longer allowed. IFRS 11 is applicable from 1 \\nApril 2013 and is expected to have a presentational \\nimpact on the Group. This is applicable to the Group from 1 \\nApril 2013 and is expected to have a presentational \\nimpact on the Group. See note 21 for \\nmore details. The remaining £0.1 million \\nrelates to redundancy costs. Grant income   \\nThe Group has a total grant allocation from the Homes and Communities Agency of £72.9 million. Grant income  \\nis recognised as revenue in the income statement on a percentage of completion basis to match with the costs \\nit is intended to compensate. The total grant allocation is made up of individual site by site allocations the receipt \\nof which is dependent upon constructing the planned affordable housing on each site. The changes had \\nnot been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore are not recognised in these financial \\nstatements. The impact of the proposed changes are not expected to be material to the Group. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is \\nadjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. See note 21 for more details. A full list of subsidiary undertakings is available on request from the Group’s registered office. 9 Inventories\\nGroup Company\\n31 March 2011\\n£000\\n31 March 2010\\n£000\\n31 March 2011\\n£000\\n31 March 2010\\n£000\\nDevelopment properties 125,181  120,047  58,300  77,953 \\nAll inventories are considered to be current in nature. The operating cycle is such that a proportion of inventories \\nwill not be realised within twelve months. During the year the Group conducted a review of the net realisable value of its inventories. These shares were cancelled on 30 September 2010 at 56p per ordinary \\nshare (note 22). Details of own shares held within employee benefit trusts are disclosed in note 17. All shares rank equally in respect of shareholder rights. Awards \\nunder each scheme are made periodically to new employees. All schemes are equity-settled and options can \\nnormally be exercised three years after the grant date. This charge is calculated at the date of grant of the options and is \\ncharged equally over the vesting period. The corresponding adjustment to equity is made directly to the profit \\nand loss reserve. The Group has used the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to calculate the fair value of outstanding options. Individual calculations have been performed for groups of share options with differing exercise prices and dates. The assumptions applied to the Black-Scholes-Merton formula for share options issued and the fair value per \\noption are set out below. Volatility in more \\nrecent years is considered to have more relevance than earlier years for the period reviewed. No share options were exercised in the year ended 31 March 2011 or the year ended 31 March 2010. This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and confers certain tax \\nadvantages for participating employees. The SIP provides for employees to purchase shares up to a value of £1,500 in each tax year. These shares are \\nknown as ‘Partnership shares’. Dividends \\nare paid on both Partnership and Matching shares and these are allocated to employees as ‘Dividend shares’. The Group has set up a trust to administer the SIP and to hold shares on behalf of individual employees. The costs associated with the trust are paid for by the Group and the Group finances all share purchases. The trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating in the \\nscheme. These shares remain in the trust until such time as an employee withdraws from the SIP. Further shares \\nhave been allocated to employees as Matching shares and the cost of these shares is being written off over the \\nthree year holding period. During the year ended 31 March 2011 the trust acquired 355,089 shares at 77p in March 2011. Shares held by the SIP are recognised as a deduction from shareholders’ funds. Movements in the profit and loss reserve relating to the SIP are \\nshown in the statement of changes in equity. This loan is interest free repayable on or before the repayment date which \\nis normally 20 years from the date of the loan or on disposing of the shares. The loan has a limited recourse \\nsuch that repayment is limited to the value of the shares on the repayment date. The Group will lend the trustee \\nsufficient funds to enable the trustee to provide the loans to individual participants. Offers to participants will be made periodically at the discretion of the directors of Telford Homes \\nPlc. These shares were issued on 9 November 2006. On this date the Group provided a loan to the \\ntrustee of £1,430,000 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. In December 2007 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 160,000 shares at the market \\nvalue of 244p. These shares were issued on 14 December 2007. On this date the Group provided a loan to the \\ntrustee of £390,400 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on \\nconsolidation. All other trade and other receivables and trade payables are due within one year. The debt drawn under \\nthis facility is secured against a portfolio of land and development sites owned by the Group. Interest is being \\ncharged on this facility at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.5%. Interest is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% on the majority of the facility. At 31\\xa0March\\xa02011 \\nBishopsgate Apartments LLP had utilised all £15.0 million of this facility. Interest is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of 4.5%. This facility is due \\nfor repayment on 14 December 2011. Interest on all \\nfacilities currently held is charged at floating interest rates and the Group assesses the requirement for fixing \\ninterest rates on a regular basis. The effect on the income statement of a 1% rise and a 1% fall in interest rates has been calculated to assess interest \\nrate sensitivity. The Group considers its capital to be all of the \\ncomponents of net assets. Credit risk\\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations. The Group considers the credit quality of the various debtors \\nto be good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low. Surplus cash is held in secure bank deposit accounts with Allied Irish Bank, The Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, \\nHSBC, Barclays Bank and Investec Bank plc. The forecasts are necessarily subject to a number \\nof assumptions and judgements and these are tested on a reasonable basis by the sensitivity analysis. These \\nforecasts and the related sensitivity analysis are reviewed by the directors in detail on a monthly basis. In all of these cases the directors are satisfied that the loans are expected to be \\nrepaid by the date the facility expires. This gain is included in exceptional items \\nin the results to 31 March 2011. Acquisition related costs amounting to £2,000 are included in administrative costs in the Group income statement. This final repayment amounted to £4.3 million. These \\nrepurchased shares were cancelled on 30 September 2010.\",\n",
       " ' This enables the Board to be confident \\nin forecasting a significant increase in profit for \\nthe year to 31 March 2013 and continued growth \\nbeyond that. Looking forward the Board expects to pay around \\na third of its future earnings in dividends. After ten years as Non-Executive Chairman  \\nDavid Holland has moved aside for me but  \\nwill continue to contribute as our senior  \\nNon-Executive Director. The Board targeted margin improvement during \\nthe year and gross and operating profit margins \\nare now moving in the right direction. The gross \\nmargin before interest charges and exceptional \\nitems has increased to 17.6 per cent (2011:  \\n15.1 per cent) and the operating margin before \\ninterest charges and exceptional items has \\nincreased to 6.2 per cent (2011: 5.2 per cent). As a \\nresult, rents in some parts of London rose by \\nmore than 10 per cent in 2011. Of \\nthese 62 were to UK buyers. Completions are due in \\nlate 2013. Tight mortgage availability restricts demand \\nfrom potential owner-occupiers and particularly \\nfirst time buyers. Lenders continue to discriminate \\nagainst new build properties by requiring higher \\ndeposits. This is an important aspect of remaining \\ncompetitive in land acquisitions. The Group has purchased its \\nfirst development site in Lambeth, near the Albert \\nEmbankment, to provide 101 homes in a new  \\n24 storey tower and also acquired its first site  \\nin the London Borough of Camden. All of these acquisitions have been purchased \\non the basis of an appropriate expected profit \\nmargin and return on capital. The majority have a \\nfull planning consent or are contracted subject to \\nachieving a satisfactory consent and all of them \\nare on ‘brownfield’ land. There are 1,487 properties under construction \\nwith the remainder expected to commence \\nwithin the next year. The number of open market homes has increased \\nto 1,677 compared to 1,338 last year. It has been a year of some changes in terms of \\nthe Board of Telford Homes. We have also welcomed Katie Rogers and David \\nCampbell to the Board during the last year. The increase in revenue is due to a greater volume \\nof open market completions partially offset by \\na reduction in the level of affordable revenue. A proportion of the selling expenses incurred in \\nthe year were in relation to successful launches \\nof new developments. Finance costs\\nFinance costs incurred in the year have increased \\nto £4.9 million from £2.7 million. This increased dividend is \\nin line with the Board’s stated intention of paying \\na year-on-year progressive dividend. The final \\ndividend is expected to be paid on 20 July 2012  \\nto those shareholders on the register at the  \\nclose of business on 22 June 2012. Cash management and  \\ncash flow forecasting\\nControl of cash remains important to the Group \\nand a detailed month-by-month cash flow \\nforecast is maintained as part of the management \\ninformation system. The forecasts are \\nnecessarily subject to a number of assumptions \\nand judgements and these are regularly analysed \\nfor reasonableness. The forecasts are reviewed by \\nthe Board in detail on a monthly basis. Borrowings\\nGross borrowings at 31 March 2012 were  \\n£67.6 million (31 March 2011: £64.9 million)  \\nand net debt was £54.6 million (31 March 2011: \\n£46.1 million). The Board monitors performance against \\nthese covenants on a monthly basis and has had \\nno issues in relation to compliance. The loan \\nis repayable by September 2014 and interest is \\ncharged at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.5 per cent. Each division predominantly specialises in \\ncertain sizes of development and styles of construction. Mark Parker and John Fitzgerald jointly take on the roles \\nand responsibilities of Group Managing Director. Mark \\nParker is responsible for Metro and John Fitzgerald is \\nresponsible for Alto and each division has a management \\nteam responsible for day-to-day operations. The Group has a \\nsupply-chain of partners that provide all the \\nnecessary design and building services to \\ncomplete each development. The Group also operates a comprehensive \\nManagement Trainee programme under which \\ntrainees from school or a place of higher \\neducation are employed annually. Trainees either \\njoin a particular department if they have chosen \\ntheir career path or are enrolled on a three year \\nprogramme where they rotate through various \\nroles. A combination of higher education and on the job \\ntraining alongside experienced staff allows the \\napprentices and trainees to develop technical as \\nwell as personal skills. The Group puts training at the heart of its \\noperations ensuring its employees maintain \\ntheir industry knowledge. We invest in the training and development of our \\npeople with the continuation of our ‘Health and \\nSafety Core’ training programme. We demand that our \\nsuppliers employ competent people and encourage \\ncontinual professional development of those \\nholding safety critical posts. To support this we \\nhave held subsidised onsite training specifically  \\nfor their employees. In the economic climate of the last few years \\na number of our suppliers have struggled \\nand some have ceased trading. As part of our \\nvetting procedure the commercial viability of \\neach supplier is scrutinised in an attempt to \\nensure they are able to meet their obligations. We continually monitor our \\nsuppliers and take the necessary steps to ensure \\nthey meet our high expectations. Our accident frequency rate for the year to \\n31 March 2012 was better than the industry \\naverage. We have implemented, \\nand will continue to run, a programme of simple \\nbehavioural based solutions to make people \\nconsciously aware of themselves and their \\ninteraction with the workplace. The RoSPA awards and the \\nBSI certification recognise the maturity of our \\noccupational health and safety management \\nsystem and the culture of the Group. John Fitzgerald and Mark Parker remain \\nresponsible for health and safety in each of the \\noperating divisions and John Fitzgerald is the \\nboard member with overall responsibility for \\nhealth and safety. The Group will always strive to \\nimprove further however our overall health and \\nsafety performance during the year has been \\nexcellent and this stands us in good stead for  \\nthe future. The Group has an environmental policy and we \\nensure that this is communicated throughout \\nour operations. Our environmental policy and \\nenvironmental management system is regularly \\nreviewed to ensure the prevention of pollution \\nand compliance with relevant legislation. We have adopted the Building Research \\nEstablishment SMARTER\\n©\\n waste programme \\nwhich assists the construction industry to manage \\nsite waste in compliance with regulations. The materials we use during our construction \\nprojects contribute to our environmental \\nperformance and as such we recognise the \\ncontribution sustainable materials make to \\nimproved environmental performance. We \\ncontinue to increase the amount of recycled \\nmaterials we use, particularly aggregates and \\ncrushed concrete in excavation reinstatements \\nand piling mats. In addition we use both \\nestablished and cutting edge technologies to \\nimprove the energy efficiency of our developments \\nonce they are occupied. We continue to \\nexplore renewable energy technologies with the \\nultimate aim of reducing the carbon footprint of \\nfuture developments. – Improved insulation values and building  \\nair tightness. Clean – 37.8 t CO\\n2\\n further saving\\n– Achieved through increased efficiency of \\ndomestic heating. – Centralised boilers and combined heat and \\npower plant together with ventilation systems \\nwith heat recovery. – Provision of low energy lighting. GReen – 6.9t CO\\n2\\n further saving\\n– Achieved through introduction of renewable  \\nenergy sources. – Photovoltaic panels located on roof areas  \\nto provide electrical energy. All of these are outside of the \\nGroup’s control. This \\nland needs to be sourced in appropriate locations \\nand where optimum planning consents can be \\nobtained. The appraisal process that determines \\nthe price paid for land is critical in maintaining \\nmargins and return on equity at acceptable levels. Our existing partnerships with housing transfer \\norganisations are expected to continue to be a \\nsource of land in the next few years. Planning process\\nThe flow of properties through the development \\npipeline is dependent on achieving suitable \\nplanning permission on sites purchased without \\nplanning or subject to planning. The process \\nis time consuming and involves a number of \\nsupporting reports and detailed consultations \\nwith many different bodies. Failure  \\nto achieve a suitable planning permission may \\nlead to cost write offs or reduced margins on \\nindividual developments. Early consultations \\nwith the planning authorities are a key part of \\nthe land acquisition process. While this cannot \\nremove planning risks it mitigates them as much \\nas possible. All bar one of the sites currently \\nowned by the Group have the benefit of a full \\nplanning permission. health and Safety\\nConstruction sites are dangerous places and \\nthere are many different health and safety risks \\nto consider. The Group’s financial and operational performance is subject to a number of risks. These risks are continually assessed by management to mitigate and minimise their \\neffects on the business. There are also many risks which are outside of the Group’s \\ncontrol. The quality of the construction work \\nand finish in each property affects the reputation \\nof the Group and can impact on repeat purchase \\nand recommendation rates. Standards of construction and control of the \\nbuilding process on site are of paramount \\nimportance to each operating division. The construction teams work very \\nclosely with the Customer Service team and their \\ninteraction commences at an early stage in the \\ndevelopment. availability of materials and labour\\nThe availability of materials and sub-contracted \\nlabour for each site can affect both the \\nconstruction programme and the cost of \\nconstruction. Build cost inflation will impact \\ndirectly on the margin achieved on each site \\nwhere this is in excess of forecasts. The tender process \\nensures that competitive rates are achieved on \\nevery trade. Forecasting of cash flows is critical to ensure \\nthe Group is not operating beyond its financial \\ncapacity. This extends five years into the future \\nand is subject to continual re-assessment and \\nsensitivity analysis. Political environment\\nChanges in laws and regulations can have a direct \\nimpact on the efficient running of the Group and \\nthe costs incurred on each development. Changes \\nin both local and national government can have a \\ndirect bearing on the regulatory environment. David had been Group \\nManaging Director since the start of \\nthe Company’s operations in 2001. He is responsible \\nfor all residential and commercial \\nproperty sales, targeting both \\ndomestic and overseas buyers. With this experience he brings a \\nwide appreciation of the development \\nprocess and the importance of \\nstrategic planning for long-term \\ncomplex projects. Andrew became Executive Chairman \\non 1 January 2012. He had one year with \\nMothercare following five years with \\nArthur Andersen. Jon became \\nChief Executive on 1 July 2011. John  \\nwas appointed a director on  \\n1 August 2007 and is the director \\nwith responsibility for health and \\nsafety throughout the business. He chairs the remuneration \\ncommittee and is a member of the \\naudit committee. He has also been \\na non-executive director of various \\nother public and private companies \\nand served on committees of national \\ncharities. Robert is chairman of the \\naudit committee and a member of  \\nthe remuneration committee. These policies are monitored to ensure that they are \\nappropriate to the Group’s circumstances and comply as far as possible with the provisions of the Code given \\nthe size of the Group. There are ten directors in total of whom two \\nare non-executive directors. The Board meets once a month \\nand the directors make every effort to attend all board meetings. The Board is responsible for taking all major strategic decisions and also addressing any significant \\noperational matters. Management information systems are in place to enable the directors to \\nmake informed decisions to properly discharge their duties. The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separate. The Chairman is responsible for running \\nthe Board and he meets regularly and separately with the Chief Executive and the non-executive directors to \\ndiscuss matters for the Board. One third of the directors retire annually in \\nrotation in accordance with the Company’s articles of association. This enables the shareholders to decide on \\nthe election of the Company’s Board. The directors are responsible for preparing the financial \\nstatements as set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. The responsibilities of the auditors are \\nset out in their report. r emuneration committee\\nDetails concerning the composition and meetings of the remuneration committee are contained in the \\ndirectors’ remuneration report on pages 40 to 41. The non-executive \\ndirectors meet separately with the auditors up to twice a year. The committee has a responsibility for reviewing the financial statements provided to shareholders. In \\naddition the committee reviews the business and financial risks and internal controls as described below. 39\\nCorporate Governance\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\nr elations with shareholders\\nThe Company has institutional shareholders and is, where practicable, willing to enter into a dialogue with \\nthem. The Chief Executive and the Financial Director meet regularly with institutional investors within the \\nconfines of relevant legislation and guidance. The Board invites communication from its private investors and encourages participation by them at the \\nAnnual General Meeting (AGM). All Board members present at the AGM are available to answer questions \\nfrom shareholders. internal control\\nThe Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board formally \\nmonitors monthly progress on each development. Composition of the remuneration committee\\nThe remuneration committee comprises the independent non-executive directors, David Holland and Robert \\nClarke. The committee makes recommendations to the Board on executive directors’ service agreements \\nand remuneration. In doing so it has undertaken relevant research to ensure that remuneration levels are \\ncompetitive with the industry average. The committee met three times during the year. Both schemes are \\ndependent on the Group meeting certain financial performance targets. The maximum amount that can be \\nearned under the executive bonus scheme is 100% of basic salary. Further details are given in note 17 to the financial statements. The remuneration \\ncommittee is responsible for approving any offers of shares made under the DPSPP. The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors after considering external \\nmarket research. They do not participate in the bonus schemes or in the personal pension scheme. They are \\nentitled to participate in the SIP. service contracts\\nThe executive directors have service contracts that can be terminated on twelve months notice. These  \\nprovide for termination payments equivalent to twelve months basic salary and contractual benefits. The non-executive directors have letters of appointment that can be terminated on three months notice. 2 Resigned from the Board on 31 March 2012. 3 Appointed to the Board on 14 July 2011. 41\\nCorporate Governance\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\ndirectors’ interests in shares and share options\\nDirectors’ interests in shares are disclosed in the report of the directors. 2 Appointed to the Board on 14 July 2011.

Options previously due to lapse on 1 October 2012 have been \\namended to lapse on 1 October 2015. No share options were exercised by directors in the year ended 31 March 2012. The directors believe that the \\nGroup is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. Accordingly  \\nthe directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts. 43\\nCorporate Governance\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk\\ndirectors\\nDetails of the directors of the Company are shown on pages 36 to 37. Katie Rogers was appointed to the Board on 14 July 2011. Sheena Ellwood resigned on 31 March 2012. 2 Appointed to the Board on 14 July 2011. All shares purchased under the SIP are matched \\nby shares provided by the Company on a one for one basis. Further details on the SIP are included in note 17 to the financial statements. Further information is disclosed in note 16. Creditors\\nIt is Group policy to settle all debts with its creditors on a timely basis. Sub-contractors are paid upon \\nagreement of the value of works completed based on their applications for payment and the terms agreed. In general, other suppliers are paid during the month following the month of receipt of the invoice unless  \\nother terms have been specifically agreed. employees\\nThe Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and keeps them informed of all \\nrelevant matters on a regular basis. Telford Homes is an equal opportunities employer and all applications  \\nfor employment are considered fully on the basis of suitability for the job. Charitable donations\\nThe Group made charitable donations of £19,000 (2011: £18,000). These donations were made to a number \\nof different charities supporting a broad range of good causes. Auditors\\nA resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the Company will be proposed at the \\nAnnual General Meeting in accordance with section 489 of the Companies Act 2006.

They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for \\ntaking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in the \\nUnited Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from \\nlegislation in other jurisdictions. Those standards require us  \\nto comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial \\ninformation in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements.

The financial statements have been prepared \\nunder the historical cost convention as modified for \\nreassessment of derivatives at fair value and on a \\ngoing concern basis. Although \\nthese estimates are based on the directors best \\nknowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual \\nresults ultimately may differ from those estimates. The accounting policies set out below have been \\napplied consistently for all periods presented in \\nthese financial statements. All intra-group \\ntransactions, balances, income and expenses are \\neliminated on consolidation. exemptions\\nThe directors have taken advantage of the exemption \\navailable under Section 408 of the Companies Act \\n2006 and have not presented an income statement \\nor statement of comprehensive income for the \\nCompany alone. Jointly controlled entities\\nA jointly controlled entity is an entity in which \\nthe Group holds an interest with one or more \\nother parties where a contractual arrangement \\nhas established joint control over the entity. Jointly controlled entities are accounted for using \\nproportional consolidation. segmental reporting\\nThe Group has only one business segment being \\nhousebuilding and one geographical segment being \\nthe United Kingdom. r evenue and profit recognition\\nProperties for open market sale\\nRevenue and profit is recognised at the point of legal \\ncompletion of each property. Construction contracts\\nContracts are treated as construction contracts \\nwhen they have been specifically negotiated for \\nthe construction of a development or a number of \\nproperties. These contracts are primarily for the \\nconstruction of affordable homes sold to affordable \\nhousing providers. Revenue is only recognised \\non a construction contract where the outcome \\ncan be estimated reliably. Revenue and costs are \\nrecognised by reference to the stage of completion \\nof contract activity at the balance sheet date. This \\nis normally measured by an assessment of work \\nperformed to date on a cost basis. Where the outcome of a construction contract \\ncannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is \\nrecognised to the extent of contract costs incurred \\nthat it is probable will be recoverable. When it is \\nprobable that total contract costs will exceed total \\ncontract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as \\nan expense immediately. On the balance sheet, the Group reports the net \\ncontract position for each contract either as an \\nasset or liability. A contract represents an asset \\nwhere costs incurred plus recognised profits exceed \\nprogress billing and a contract represents a liability \\nwhere the opposite is the case. These are disclosed \\nas amounts recoverable on contracts. selling expenses\\nSelling expenses are charged to the income \\nstatement as incurred. Financial Statements\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk 53\\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the \\ndevelopment of properties that take a substantial \\nperiod of time to get ready for sale, are capitalised \\nwithin inventories. Capitalisation of borrowing costs \\ncommences from the date of initial expenditure \\non a given development and continues until the \\nproperties are ready for sale. Capitalisation is not normally suspended during a \\nperiod when substantial technical and administrative \\nwork is being carried out. All other borrowing costs are charged to the income \\nstatement using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs paid are classified as operating \\nactivities in the cash flow statement. interest rate cap assets\\nInterest rate caps are individually valued at each \\nperiod end and adjusted to ensure that they are held \\nat fair value. exceptional items\\nExceptional items are those significant items which \\nare separately disclosed by virtue of their size or \\nincidence to enable a full understanding of the \\nGroup’s financial performance. f inance leases and hire purchase contracts\\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the \\nterms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks \\nand rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other \\nleases are classified as operating leases. The corresponding liability is included in the \\nbalance sheet as a finance lease or hire purchase \\nobligation. Finance charges  \\nare charged to the income statement. o perating leases\\nOperating lease rentals are charged to the income \\nstatement on a straight line basis over the life of \\nthe lease. property, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less \\naccumulated depreciation. inventories\\nDevelopment properties are included in inventories \\nand are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable \\nvalue. Cost comprises costs of acquisition and \\ndevelopment, including directly attributable fees and \\nexpenses, direct labour costs and borrowing costs. These are held for \\nfuture sale. financial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are \\nrecognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the \\nGroup becomes a party to the contractual provision \\nof the instrument.

Deposits received in advance\\nDeposits received on exchange of contracts of open \\nmarket properties are held within trade and other \\npayables until legal completion of the related property. Fair \\nvalue is determined by using the effective interest \\nmethod. Financial liabilities and equity instruments\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are \\nclassified according to the substance of the \\ncontractual arrangements entered into. An equity \\ninstrument is any contract that evidences a residual \\ninterest in the assets of the Group after deducting \\nall of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the \\nGroup are recorded at the proceeds received, net of \\ndirect issue costs. t axation\\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the tax \\ncurrently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on the profits \\nfor the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit \\nas reported in the income statement because it \\nexcludes items of income or expense that are tax \\ndeductible in other years and it further excludes \\nitems that are never taxable or deductible. The \\nGroup’s liability for current tax is calculated using \\ntax rates that have been enacted or substantively \\nenacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary \\ndifferences that have originated but not reversed at \\nthe balance sheet date where transactions or events \\nthat result in an obligation to pay more tax in the \\nfuture or a right to pay less tax in the future have \\noccurred at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income \\nstatement, except when it relates to items charged \\nor credited directly to equity, in which case the \\ndeferred tax is also dealt with in equity. With respect to share-based payments, a deferred \\ntax asset is recognised on the relevant tax base. The \\ntax base is then compared to the cumulative share-\\nbased payment expense recognised in the income \\nstatement. Financial Statements\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk 55\\ncritical accounting judgements and key \\nsources of estimation uncertainty\\nConstruction contract revenue and profit recognition\\nContract revenue is recognised from the date \\nof exchange of construction contracts at a rate \\nequivalent to the value of work undertaken in respect \\nof land development. Contract profit on construction \\ncontracts is recognised in proportion to revenue \\nonly to the extent that the total eventual profit on the \\ncontract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Assessing the percentage complete on each contract \\ninvolves estimation of total expected costs to be \\nincurred until the end of the contract. Recognition \\nof profit also involves estimation of the total \\nexpected revenues from each contract and therefore \\nthe expected profit margin that will be achieved. Carrying value of land and work in progress\\nInventories include land and work in progress in \\nrespect of development sites. •\\t IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ provides for a \\nmore realistic reflection of joint arrangements \\nby focusing on the rights and obligations of the \\narrangement, rather than its legal form. •\\t IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interest in other entities’ \\nincludes the disclosure requirements for all forms \\nof interests in other entities.

Awards \\nunder each scheme are made periodically to new employees. All schemes are equity-settled and options can \\nnormally be exercised three years after the grant date. This \\ncharge is calculated at the date of grant of the options and is charged equally over the vesting period. The \\ncorresponding adjustment to equity is made directly to the profit and loss reserve. The Group has used the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to calculate the fair value of outstanding options. Individual calculations have been performed for groups of share options with differing exercise prices and \\ndates. Volatility in \\nmore recent years is considered to have more relevance than earlier years for the period reviewed. No share options were exercised in the year ended 31 March 2012 or the year ended 31 March 2011. Options previously due to lapse on 5 March 2012 and 1 October 2012 have been amended to lapse on  \\n5 March 2015 and 1 October 2015 respectively. Financial Statements\\nwww.telfordhomes.plc.uk 67\\nTelford homes Plc Share Incentive Plan\\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2004 Telford h omes Plc set up a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) for the benefit \\nof all of the employees of the Group. This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and confers certain \\ntax advantages for participating employees. The SIP provides for employees to purchase shares up to a value of £1,500 in each tax year. These shares \\nare known as ‘Partnership shares’. Dividends are paid on both Partnership and Matching shares and these are allocated to employees as \\n‘Dividend shares’. The Group has set up a trust to administer the SIP and to hold shares on behalf of individual employees. The costs associated with the trust are paid for by the Group and the Group finances all \\nshare purchases. The trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating in the \\nscheme. These shares remain in the trust until such time as an employee withdraws from the SIP. Further \\nshares have been allocated to employees as Matching shares and the cost of these shares is being written off \\nover the three year holding period. During the year ended 31 March 2012 the trust acquired 500,000 shares at 95.5p in March 2012. Shares held by the SIP are recognised as a deduction from shareholders’ funds. Movements in the profit and loss reserve relating to the SIP \\nare shown in the statement of changes in equity. This loan is interest free repayable on or before the \\nrepayment date which is normally 20 years from the date of the loan or on leaving employment or disposing \\nof the shares. The loan has a limited recourse such that repayment is limited to the value of the shares on \\nthe repayment date. The Group will lend the trustee sufficient funds to enable the trustee to provide the loans \\nto individual participants. Offers to participants will be made periodically \\nat the discretion of the directors of Telford homes Plc. In September 2006 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 550,000 shares at the \\nmarket value of 260p. These shares were issued on 9 November 2006. On this date the Group provided a \\nloan to the trustee of £1,430,000 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. In December 2007 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 160,000 shares at the \\nmarket value of 244p. These shares were issued on 14 December 2007. On this date the Group provided a \\nloan to the trustee of £390,400 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. The Group signed a new 10 year lease in June 2011 for its head office premises.

Trade and other receivables, trade payables and hire purchase liabilities\\nThe fair value of trade and other receivables, trade payables and hire purchase liabilities at 31 March 2012 \\nis equal to the carrying value stated in the balance sheet at that date. All other trade and other receivables and trade payables are due \\nwithin one year. The debt drawn under this facility is secured against a portfolio of land and development sites owned by the \\nGroup. Interest is being charged on this facility at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.5%. The remaining £14.6 million is \\nrepayable in phases by 30 June 2012, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013. Interest is charged on the remainder of the debt at LIBOR plus a margin \\nof 2.25%. The debt drawn under this facility is secured against the land and development \\nsite owned by the partnership. Interest is being charged on this facility at LIBOR \\nplus a margin of 3.5%. All borrowings are treated as current even though these may be due for settlement after twelve months  \\nfrom the balance sheet date as they are expected to be settled in the Group’s normal operating cycle. All borrowings are stated at fair value which is materially equivalent to the original book value. Interest on all facilities currently held is charged at floating interest rates and the Group \\nassesses the requirement for fixing interest rates on a regular basis. The Group has purchased two interest \\nrate caps in the period. The effect on the income statement of a 1% rise and a 1% fall in interest rates has been calculated to assess \\ninterest rate sensitivity. The Group considers its capital to be all of the \\ncomponents of equity and long term liabilities.

Trade and other receivables includes amounts recoverable on contracts which are due from housing \\nassociations and balances due from other Group undertakings. The Group considers the credit quality \\nof the various debtors to be good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is \\nconsidered to be low. Surplus cash is held in secure bank deposit accounts with The Royal Bank of Scotland, hSBC and Santander. Liquidity risk\\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations  \\nas they fall due. The forecasts are necessarily subject \\nto a number of assumptions and judgements and these are tested on a reasonable basis by the sensitivity \\nanalysis. These forecasts and the related sensitivity analysis are reviewed by the directors in detail on a \\nmonthly basis. In addition all of the forecasts and supporting calculations are made available to each bank \\nfunding the Group on a monthly basis. In all of these cases the directors are satisfied that the loans are \\nexpected to be repaid by the date the facility expires.

We’ve invested into this slowdown \\nand that has given us good momentum through the recession. Are there \\nany signs that we have perhaps reached the bottom of the \\nrecession? What lies in store for the economy do you think?

At a time when customers everywhere are \\nfeeling the economic strain, we are responding  \\nto their changing needs in all our markets by \\nlowering prices, introducing more affordable \\nproducts and offering even sharper promotions. t he g roup has continued to make good progress with this strategy, which \\nhas five elements, reflecting our four established areas of focus, and  \\nalso t esco’s long-term commitments on community and environment.

We try to deliver what customers want better than our competitors by \\nunderstanding and responding to their behaviour. We manage the acquisition and development of our property \\nassets carefully. Competition and consolidation t he retail industry is highly competitive. People capabilities our greatest asset is our employees. We review our people \\npolicies regularly and are committed to investing in training and \\ndevelopment and incentives for our people. o ur ‘t alent planning’ process \\nhelps individuals achieve their full potential. Reputational risk as the largest retailer in the UK, expectations of the \\ng roup are high. Failure to protect the g roup’s reputation and brand could \\nlead to a loss of trust and confidence. l ike other companies we must consider potential threats to our reputation \\nand the consequences of reputational damage. We develop \\nenvironmental policy through engaging with key stakeholders and experts \\nin this field to achieve sustainable growth and minimise our environmental \\nimpacts. t he g roup’s approach is brought together in a consistent manner \\nby the c orporate Responsibility c ommittee. policy is reviewed regularly by the c ompliance c ommittee and c orporate \\nResponsibility c ommittee. We recognise the opportunities for competitive \\nadvantage through energy efficiency and look for continuous \\nimprovement through innovations and better ways to help customers act \\nresponsibly towards the environment. Product safety t he safety and quality of our products is of paramount \\nimportance to t esco as well as being essential for maintaining customer \\ntrust and confidence. a breach in confidence could affect the size of our \\ncustomer base and hence financial results. We have detailed and established procedures for ensuring product \\nintegrity at all times, especially for our own-label products. t here are  \\nstrict product safety processes and regular management reports. We  \\nwork in partnership with suppliers to ensure mutual understanding of  \\nthe standards required. We have clear processes for crisis \\nmanagement, pulling together expert teams should we need to respond \\nquickly on issues. at the heart of our v alues is our belief that \\nwe should treat people as we like to be treated and we have a responsibility \\nto help workers in our supply chain enjoy fair labour standards. t here is, however, a risk that any part of the \\nsupply chain might not adhere to these high standards. t o minimise this risk we only work with suppliers who can demonstrate \\nthat they are committed to the eti code and share our values. We continue to operate a \\ncomprehensive programme of audit improvements, including more \\nunannounced audits, a t rading Fairly strategy and an industry-leading \\nauditor Recognition programme. We have also sought to involve more \\nmulti-stakeholder representatives on our audits to improve workforce \\nengagement and enable activists to see and feedback on our approach. t he g roup takes extensive steps to reduce this risk. internal audit undertakes detailed investigations into \\nall areas of the business and highlights its findings to the audit c ommittee. t he compliance committee formulates and monitors the implementation \\nof, and compliance with appropriate policies on key areas of ethical \\nbehaviour, including fraud. t he complexity of many of our property developments is \\nincreasing, especially the growing number of mixed-use schemes. We also have to comply with design and construction standards which  \\nvary significantly from country to country. IT systems and infrastructure t he business is dependent on efficient \\ninformation technology (it ) systems. any significant failure in the it \\nprocesses of our retail operations (e.g. barcode scanning or supply chain \\nlogistics) would impact our ability to trade. We recognise the essential role \\nthat it plays across our operations in allowing us to trade efficiently and  \\nso that we can achieve commercial advantage through implementing  \\nit innovations that improve the shopping trip for customers and make life \\neasier for employees. We may also be impacted \\nby political developments in the countries in which we operate. We \\nconsider these uncertainties in the external environment when developing \\nstrategy and reviewing performance. We remain vigilant to future changes. t he g roup has considered its pension risks and has taken action \\nby reducing risk in its investment strategy. Joint venture governance and partnerships as we continue to enter \\ninto new partnerships and joint ventures as well as developing existing \\narrangements, there remains an inherent risk in managing these partnerships \\nand joint ventures. it is more difficult to guarantee the achievement of joint \\ngoals that affect our partners and we rely on partners to help achieve such \\ngoals. We may also be impacted by reputational issues which affect our \\npartners. We choose partners with good reputations and set out joint goals \\nand clear contractual arrangements from the outset. We monitor performance \\nand governance of our joint ventures and partnerships. t hese risks are managed as described below. t he \\ng roup Balance sheet position at 28 February 2009 is representative of  \\nthe position throughout the year. t he \\nobjective is to ensure continuity of funding. t esco g roup has a long-term rating of a 3 by moody’s and a- by s tandard \\nand poor’s with a stable outlook. Interest rate risk management t he objective is to limit our exposure to \\nincreases in interest rates while retaining the opportunity to benefit from \\ninterest rate reductions. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps \\nand collars are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Foreign currency risk management our principal objective is to reduce \\nthe effect of exchange rate volatility on short-term profits. We \\nhedge the majority of our investments in our international subsidiaries via \\nforeign exchange transactions in matching currencies. We translate overseas profits at average foreign \\nexchange rates which we do not currently seek to hedge. t he g roup’s positions with these \\ncounterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. all policies pertaining to risk within tp F are now subject  \\nto tp F governance procedures which are owned by the tp F Board. t esco insurance l imited covers assets and earnings, \\nwhile valiant insurance c ompany l imited covers c ombined l iability. t hese statements should be \\ntreated with caution due to the inherent risks and uncertainties underlying \\nany such forward-looking information.

Legislation in the UK concerning the preparation and dissemination of \\nfinancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the \\naccounting policies set out therein. The notes on pages 72 to 123 form part of these financial statements. NB. The reconciliation of net cash flow to movement in net debt note is not a primary statement and does not form part of the cash flow statement and forms part of the notes to the financial statements. The address of the registered office is Tesco House, Delamare \\nRoad, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, EN8 9SL, UK. Basis of preparation\\nThe financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, rounded to the \\nnearest million. Subsidiaries\\nA subsidiary is an entity whose operating and financing policies are \\ncontrolled, directly or indirectly, by Tesco PLC. Joint ventures and associates\\nA joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long-\\nterm basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more \\nother venturers under a contractual agreement. Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group Balance \\nSheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net \\nassets of the entity, less any impairment in value. The carrying values of \\ninvestments in joint ventures and associates include acquired goodwill. The estimates and associated assumptions are \\nbased on historical experience and various other factors that are believed \\nto be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the \\nbasis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities \\nthat are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ \\nfrom these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing \\nbasis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in \\nwhich the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or  \\nin the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both \\ncurrent and future periods. Revenue\\nRetailing\\nRevenue consists of sales through retail outlets. Commission income is recorded based on the terms of the contracts and  \\nis recognised when the service is provided. Financial Services\\nRevenue consists of interest, fees and commission receivable. The arrangements are generally contractual and the cost of \\nproviding the service is incurred as the service is rendered. The price is \\nusually fixed and always determinable. Significant fee types include credit \\ncard related services fees such as interchange, late payment and balance \\ntransfer fees. Insurance commission received by the Group is accrued over the term  \\nof the policy. On redemption, the cost of redemption is offset \\nagainst the accrual. Computers for Schools and Sport for Schools and Clubs vouchers are \\nissued by Tesco for redemption by participating schools/clubs and are part \\nof our overall Community Plan. The cost of the redemption (i.e. meeting \\nthe obligation attached to the vouchers) is treated as a cost rather than as \\na deduction from sales. Dividends \\nare recognised when a legal entitlement to payment arises. Borrowing costs\\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction  \\nof qualifying assets are capitalised. Qualifying assets are those that \\nnecessarily take a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended \\nuse. The depreciation \\npolicies for investment property are consistent with those described for \\nowner-occupied property. Leasing\\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease \\ntransfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis \\nover the term of the relevant lease. The corresponding \\nliability is included in the Group Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. Finance charges are charged to the \\nGroup Income Statement. Sale and leaseback\\nA sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an asset and \\nimmediately reacquires the use of that asset by entering into a lease with \\nthe buyer. Following initial recognition, the lease treatment is consistent with those \\nprinciples described above. Business combinations and goodwill\\nAll business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion \\nof the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised. The Group recognises intangible assets as part of business combinations  \\nat fair value at the date of acquisition. The \\nuseful lives of intangible assets are estimated, and amortisation charged \\non a straight-line basis. a discount on acquisition) then the difference is credited to the  \\nGroup Income Statement in the period of acquisition. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually by assessing the \\nrecoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill \\nrelates. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, \\nand value in use. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating \\nunit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement \\nand is not subsequently reversed. Internally-generated intangible assets – Research and  \\ndevelopment expenditure\\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and \\nvalue in use. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating \\nunit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount \\nof the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as \\nincome immediately. Other investments\\nOther investments in the Group Balance Sheet comprise equity \\ninvestments and available-for-sale financial assets. Refer to the financial \\ninstruments accounting policy for further detail. Equity investments are recognised at amortised cost and available-for-sale \\nfinancial assets are recognised at fair value. Short-term investments\\nShort-term investments in the Group Balance Sheet consist of deposits \\nwith money market funds. Non-current assets held for sale\\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale  \\nif their carrying amount will be recovered through sale rather than \\ncontinuing use. Management must be committed to the sale \\nand it should be expected to be completed within one year from the date \\nof classification. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are \\nmeasured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Actuarial \\ngains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group Statement of \\nRecognised Income and Expense. Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense \\nas they fall due. The value of the charge is adjusted  \\nto reflect expected and actual levels of vesting. Taxation\\nThe tax expense included in the Group Income Statement consists of \\ncurrent and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Group Income Statement except to the \\nextent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case  \\nit is recognised in equity. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that \\ntaxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary \\ndifferences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when  \\nthere is a legally enforceable right to set-off current taxation assets  \\nagainst current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these  \\non a net basis. Foreign currencies\\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on \\nthe date of the transaction. At each Balance Sheet date, monetary assets \\nand liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated \\nat the rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. All differences are taken \\nto the Group Income Statement for the period. Such translation \\ndifferences are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which \\nthe operation is disposed of. Financial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s \\nBalance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual \\nprovisions of the instrument. Trade receivables\\nTrade receivables are non interest-bearing and are recognised initially at \\nfair value, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nrate method, reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated \\nirrecoverable amounts. Investments\\nInvestments are recognised at trade date. Investments are classified as \\neither held for trading or available-for-sale, and are recognised at fair value. There are no investments classified as held for trading. Interest calculated using the effective interest rate method is \\nrecognised in the Group Income Statement. Income from these \\nfinancial assets is calculated on an effective yield basis and is recognised  \\nin the Group Income Statement. Impairment losses are assessed individually for financial assets \\nthat are individually significant and collectively for assets that are not \\nindividually significant. Historical loss experience is \\nadjusted, on the basis of current observable data, to reflect the effects  \\nof current conditions not affecting the period of historical experience. Loan impairment provisions are established on a portfolio basis taking  \\ninto account the level of arrears, security, past loss experience, credit  \\nscores and defaults based on portfolio trends. The portfolios include credit card receivables and other \\npersonal advances. Financial liabilities and equity instruments\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to  \\nthe substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity \\ninstrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of  \\nthe Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Trade payables\\nTrade payables are non interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost. Equity instruments\\nEquity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds \\nreceived, net of direct issue costs. Where derivatives do \\nnot qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement \\nare immediately recognised in the Group Income Statement. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document \\nfrom inception the relationship between the item being hedged and the \\nhedging instrument. This effectiveness testing is performed at \\neach period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective. Fair value hedging\\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges  \\nwhen they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of  \\na recognised asset or liability. The associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and \\nrecognised in the Group Income Statement in the same period or periods \\nduring which the hedged transaction affects the Group Income Statement. The classification of the effective portion when recognised in the Group \\nIncome Statement is the same as the classification of the hedged \\ntransaction. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires  \\nor is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge \\naccounting. Net investment hedging\\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges \\nwhen they hedge the Group’s net investment in an overseas operation. Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the Group Income \\nStatement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the \\nGroup Income Statement when the foreign operation is disposed of. Where the liability is in a currency other than Pounds \\nSterling, the liability has been designated as a net investment hedge. Any \\nchange in the value of the liability resulting from changes in exchange \\nrates is recognised directly in equity. Securitisation transactions\\nDuring 2008/9 the Group has entered into a securitisation transaction  \\nand issued debt securities. Where \\nmaterial these leases are discounted to their present value. Provisions  \\nfor dilapidation costs are recognised on a lease by lease basis. Recent accounting developments\\nStandards, amendments and interpretations effective for 2008/9  \\nor issued and early adopted:\\nIn preparing the Group financial statements for the current year, the Group \\nhas adopted the following new IFRS, amendments to IFRS and IFRIC \\nInterpretations which have not had a significant impact on the results or \\nnet assets of the Group:\\n Amendments to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and •\\t\\nMeasurement’ and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, effective \\nfrom 1 July 2008. These amendments permit the reclassification of \\nfinancial assets in particular circumstances. The adoption of the \\namendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 has had no impact on the results  \\nor net assets of the Group. The standard has been revised  \\nto require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to  \\na qualifying asset. There are no exceptional items in 2008/9 and 2007/8. These measures \\nare used for internal performance analysis. It is not intended to be a substitute \\nfor, or superior to IFRS measurements of profit. The Group believes these arrangements remain effective and \\neconomically and commercially viable hedges despite the inability  \\nto apply hedge accounting. The underlying \\nprofit measure removes this volatility to help better identify underlying \\nbusiness performance. The leases have been \\nstructured in a way to increase annual lease costs as the businesses \\nexpand. The impact of this treatment in 2008/9 was  \\nan adverse charge of £27m (2007/8 – £18m) to the Group Income \\nStatement after deducting the impact of the straight-line treatment \\nrecognised as rental income within share of post-tax profits of joint \\nventures and associates. The results of the \\nUS business have been reported as a separate reporting segment within International in our results for 2008/9. The comparatives have been restated  \\nto reflect the US as a separate segment. The impact of this is to transfer sales of £16m and a loss of £67m from the UK segment to the US segment  \\nin 2007/8. The Rest of Europe reporting segment includes the Republic of Ireland, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Turkey. The Asia reporting segment includes Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, China, Japan and India. Unallocated items comprise mainly interest-bearing borrowings and taxation related assets/liabilities. Inter-segment turnover between the geographical areas of business is not material. In 2007/8,  \\nthe US employees were included in the UK reporting segment. Finance costs of £30m (2008 – £nil) resulted from hedge ineffectiveness. Taxation in other jurisdictions is calculated at \\nthe rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial  \\nreporting purposes:\\n       2009 2008 \\n        £m £m\\nDeferred tax assets             21 104\\nDeferred tax liabilities             (696) (802)\\n                (675) (698)\\nNo deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, because the earnings are continually reinvested by \\nthe Group and no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. The temporary difference unrecognised at the year end amounted to \\n£1,726m (2008 – £1,053m). Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of £32m (2008 – £39m in \\n2012) that will expire in 2013 and £647m (2008 – £57m in 2028) that will expire between 2014 and 2029. Other losses will be carried forward indefinitely. It will be paid on 10 July 2009 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 1 May 2009. All operations are continuing for the years presented. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at \\nwhich management monitor that goodwill. In 2008/9, recoverable amounts \\nare based on value in use. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations  \\nof future changes in the market. A 0.2% reduction in the long-term growth rate or a 0.2% increase in the discount rate would cause goodwill to exceed its value in use. Management determined that there has been no impairment. Interest capitalised is deducted in determining taxable profit in the year in which it is incurred. (f) Capital work in progress does not include land. Cash-generating units are tested for \\nimpairment if there are indications of impairment at the Balance Sheet date. Changes in selling prices and direct costs  \\nare based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market. In all cases, impairment losses arose due to stores performing below forecasted trading levels. In all cases, impairment losses arose due to the malls performing below forecasted trading levels. This fair value has been determined by applying an \\nappropriate rental yield to the rentals earned by the investment property. A valuation has not been performed by an independent valuer. z o.o. All principal subsidiary undertakings operate in their country of incorporation. A full list of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings will be annexed to the next Annual Return filed at Companies House. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of subsidiary undertakings to transfer funds to the parent, other than those imposed by the Companies \\nAct 1985. Interests in joint ventures and associates\\nThe Group uses the equity method of accounting for joint ventures and associates. 2) Limited Partnership\\n† \\nProperty Investment     50%     Jersey\\n† Held by an intermediate subsidiary. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of associated undertakings to transfer funds to the parent, other than those imposed by the \\nCompanies Act 1985. This loan has been classed as an equity investment as there is no interest receivable and no fixed repayment date. No impairment charges were recognised on the loan since the date of acquisition. Credit terms vary by geography and the nature of the debt and can be from 7 to 60 days. Trade receivables are recorded at amortised cost, reduced by estimated allowances for doubtful debts. The amount of the provision was £44m  \\n(2008 – £29m). Note 17 Loans and advances to customers \\nTesco Personal Finance Group Limited has loans and advances to customers. Loan impairment provisions of £250m were held \\nagainst these loans. There are no loans and advances which are past due and impaired. The maturity date of the notes \\nmatches the maturity date of the underlying assets and are repayable within one year from the balance sheet date. The maximum indexation of the principal in any one year is 5%, with a minimum of 0%. (d) The 1.982% RPI MTN is redeemable at par, indexed for increases in the RPI over the life of the MTN. Hedging policies using derivative financial instruments are further explained below. Derivatives that are held as hedging instruments are formally \\ndesignated as hedges as defined in IAS 39. Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as described below. Finance costs of £30m (2008 – £nil) resulted from hedge ineffectiveness. Fair value hedges  \\nThe Group maintains interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued \\nby the Group. A gain of £1,197m on hedging instruments was recognised during the year, offset by a loss of £1,227m on hedged items (in 2008, a gain of £261m on \\nhedging instruments was offset by a loss of £261m on hedged items). Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, mark-to-market gains \\nand losses are deferred in equity. The hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars. Net investment hedges  \\nThe Group uses forward foreign currency contracts, currency denominated borrowings and currency options to hedge the exposure of a proportion  \\nof its non-Sterling denominated assets against changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. This liability has been designated as a net investment hedge of a proportion of the assets of Samsung Tesco Co. Limited. This liability \\nhas been designated as a net investment hedge of a proportion of the assets of Hymall. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Group Income Statement on disposal of the overseas operation. Financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting\\nThe Group’s policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes; however, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically  \\nnot designated as a hedge where natural offset is appropriate. The above table excludes \\nother receivables/payables, which have fair values equal to their carrying values. These risks are managed as described below. Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Interest rate risk\\nInterest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Debt issued at variable rates exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Debt issued at fixed \\nrates exposes the Group to fair value risk. Our interest rate management policy is explained on page 40. The Group has RPI debt where the principal is indexed to increases in the RPI index. RPI debt is treated as floating rate debt. LPI debt is treated as fixed rate debt. The Group policy on credit risk is described on page 40. The counterparty exposure under derivative contracts is £1,860m (2008 – £313m). The Group policy is to transact derivatives only with counterparties \\nrated at least A1 by Moody’s. For credit risk relating to TPF please refer to the separate section on TPF financial risk factors. For liquidity risk relating to TPF please refer to the separate section on TPF financial risk factors. The following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivatives. The undiscounted cash flows will differ from both the carrying values and fair value. Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the \\nBalance Sheet date. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at the Balance Sheet date. For index linked liabilities, inflation is \\nestimated at 3% for the life of the liability. Transactional exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged. These exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges. The notional and fair value of these \\ncontracts is shown in note 22. (b)  Net investment exposure, from the value of net investments outside the UK. (c)  Loans to non-UK subsidiaries. These are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are not formally \\ndesignated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset. The impact on Group financial instruments from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity analysis below. The impact on equity \\nwill largely be offset by the revaluation in equity of the hedged assets. The target for the value of share buy-backs was \\nincreased from £1.5bn to £3.0bn over a five-year period from April 2007. Early in 2008/9 we purchased and cancelled £100m ordinary shares. The policy for debt is to ensure a smooth debt maturity profile with the objective of ensuring continuity of funding. This policy continued during the \\ncurrent year with bonds redeemed of £524m and new bonds issued totalling £4,901m. TPF policy seeks to minimise the sensitivity \\nof net interest income to changes in interest rates. Risk is managed through arm’s length cash transactions. Limits have been established for all counterparties based on their \\nrespective credit ratings. Internal reporting and oversight of risk assets is principally differentiated by credit ratings. Internal ratings are used to assess the credit quality of \\nborrowers. Customers are assigned credit ratings, based on various credit grading models that reflect the probability of default. To meet regulatory requirements a diversified portfolio of high quality liquid and marketable assets is \\nmaintained. Cash flow commitments and marketable asset holdings are measured and managed on a daily basis. Insurance \\nrisk is the risk of fluctuations in the timing, frequency or severity of insured events, relative to the expectations at the time of underwriting. Property insurance \\nThe major causes of claims for property insurance are theft, flood, escape of water, fire, storm, subsidence and various types of accidental damage. The major source of uncertainty is the volatility of weather. Note 24 Customer deposits\\n        2009 2008 \\n            £m £m\\nCustomer deposits          4,538 –\\nCustomer deposits are recorded at amortised cost and are repayable on demand. The majority of the provision is expected to be utilised over the period to 2020. Of this amount £204m (2008 – £199m) will be equity-settled and £38m (2008 – £29m) cash-settled. iii)  The Approved Executive Share Option Scheme (1994) was adopted on 17 October 1994. There were  \\nno discounted options granted under this scheme. iv)  The Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme (1996) was adopted on 7 June 1996. There were no \\ndiscounted options granted under this scheme. This scheme permits the grant to selected non-UK \\nexecutives of options to acquire ordinary shares on substantially the same basis as their UK counterparts. There were no discounted options granted under this scheme. vi)  The Executive Incentive Plan (2004) was adopted on 5 July 2004. This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected \\nexecutives. Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration. This scheme permits the grant of options in \\nrespect of ordinary shares to selected executives. Options granted before 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between four and ten years from \\nthe date of grant for nil consideration. Options granted after 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of \\ngrant for nil consideration. viii)  The Discretionary Share Option Plan (2004) was adopted on 5 July 2004. This scheme permits the grant of approved, unapproved and international \\noptions in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives. Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant  \\nat a price not less than the middle-market quotation or average middle-market quotations of an ordinary share for the dealing day or three dealing \\ndays preceding the date of grant. There will be no discounted options granted under this scheme. This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary \\nshares to selected executives. No assumption has been made to incorporate the effects of expected early exercise. Each year, shares are awarded as a \\npercentage of earnings up to a statutory maximum of £3,000. The amount paid to employees is based on a percentage of salary and is \\npaid partly in cash and partly in shares. Selected senior management participate in the senior management Performance Share Plan. Awards made under this plan will normally vest three years \\nafter the date of the award for nil consideration. Eligible ROI employees are able to participate in a Share Bonus Scheme, an all-employee profit sharing scheme. Each year, employees receive a \\npercentage of their earnings as either cash or shares. The Executive Directors participate in short-term and long-term bonus schemes designed to align their interests with those of shareholders. Full details \\nof these schemes can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. Watson Wyatt Limited, an independent actuary, carried out the latest triennial actuarial \\nassessment of the scheme as at 31 March 2008, using the projected unit method. At the date of the last actuarial valuation the actuarial deficit was £275m. The One Stop Senior Executives Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme open to senior executives and certain other employees at the \\ninvitation of the Company. Overseas\\nThe most significant overseas scheme is the funded defined benefit pension scheme which operates in the Republic of Ireland. Watson Wyatt Limited have updated the most recent Republic of Ireland valuation. The main financial assumption is the real discount rate i.e. the excess of the discount rate over the rate of price inflation. UK mortality assumptions  \\nThe Company conducts analysis of mortality trends under the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme in the UK as part of the triennial actuarial valuation of the \\nScheme. PFA92C00 for female members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be half a year older than actual age. PFA92C00 for female members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be half a year older than actual age. The expected rate of return on equities and cash have both been set having regard to expected returns over the medium term, as \\ncalculated by the Company’s independent actuary. The expected rate of return on bonds was measured directly from actual yields for gilts and \\ncorporate bond stocks. Revisions to this assumption will \\nbe reflected in the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. The purpose of the \\nvaluation is to agree a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities. The excess of the consideration over the nominal value has been charged to retained earnings. The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at the meetings  \\nof the Company. Translation reserve\\nThe translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries. It is also  \\nused to record the movements in net investment hedges. The voting rights in relation to the shares are exercisable by the Trustee, however, in accordance with investor guidelines the Trustee abstains from voting. Other reserves\\nThe merger reserve arose on the acquisition of Hillards PLC in 1987. However, if an irrevocable agreement is signed between the Company and a third party, they can \\ncontinue to buy back shares on behalf of the Company. A liability of £100m was \\nrecognised within other payables for this amount. There were no such agreements in place in 2009. Capital redemption reserve\\nUpon cancellation of the shares purchased as part of the share buy-back, a capital redemption reserve is created representing the nominal value of the \\nshares cancelled. This is a non-distributable reserve. Acquisition \\naccounting has been applied and the goodwill arising has been capitalised and is subject to annual impairment testing. Other acquisitions\\nThe other acquisitions in the year include the trade and assets of Sandyholm Garden Centre and some smaller businesses. The companies acquired \\nundertake retail activities. The post-acquisition contribution of the other acquisitions to the Group was £5m to revenue and £1m to operating profit. Note 32 Related party transactions\\nTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this \\nnote. The accounts for those partnerships have been consolidated into these accounts pursuant to \\nRegulation 7 of the Regulations. The limited partnership contains three superstores \\nwhich have been sold from and leased back to Tesco. The Group sold assets for net proceeds of £199m to the joint venture which had a net book value \\nof approximately £107m. The limited partnership contains four \\nsuperstores which have been sold from and leased back to Tesco. The Group sold assets for net proceeds of £222m to the joint venture which had a net \\nbook value of £136m. Another smaller transaction with BP Pension Trustees was completed in June 2008 where £44m of assets were transferred. The limited partnership contains 21 superstores \\nwhich have been sold from and leased back to Tesco. The Group sold assets for net proceeds of £652m to the joint venture which had a net book value  \\nof approximately £350m. iii) Transactions with key management personnel\\nOnly members of the Board of Directors of Tesco PLC are deemed to be key management personnel. It is the Board who have responsibility for \\nplanning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group. Key management personnel compensation is disclosed in the audited part of the \\nDirectors’ Remuneration Report. For details of assets held under finance leases, which are pledged as security for the finance lease liabilities, see note 11. There are a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business which if realised are not expected to result in a material liability  \\nto the Group. The Group recognises provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not a settlement will be required and the value of such a payment \\ncan be reliably estimated. We continue to defend our case vigorously. No provision has been recognised in the Group’s results. The amount is intended to provide an indication of the volume of business transacted and not of the underlying credit or  \\nother risks. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (‘FSCS’) compensates customers of UK financial institutions when those institutions are unable to pay \\nout. Going forward further \\nprovisions in respect of these costs are likely, the ultimate cost of which remains uncertain. There are also a small number of buildings which are held \\nunder finance leases. The average term of finance leases entered into was three years and these all expired in 2008. The interest rate inherent in the leases was fixed \\nat the contract date for all of the lease term. The average effective interest rate contracted approximated to 2.6% per annum. The leases have varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights. Operating lease commitments with joint ventures  \\nSince 1988, the Group has entered into several joint ventures and sold and leased back properties to and from these joint ventures. The Group reviews the substance  \\nas well as the form of the arrangements when making the judgement as to whether these leases are operating or finance leases; all of the leases under \\nthese arrangements are operating leases. Operating lease receivables – Group as lessor\\nThe Group both rents out its investment properties and also sublets various leased buildings under operating leases. Operating margin is based upon revenue excluding VAT. 3  Share of results of joint ventures and associates is stated net of the interest and tax of the Group’s joint ventures and associates. The Group’s charges for interest and tax have been reduced \\nby these amounts. 4 Consists of the net result of the Taiwanese business which was sold during 2006/7. For further \\ndetails of this measure, see page 78. 6 Results have been restated to reflect the US as a separate segment. 8 Basic and diluted earnings per share are on a continuing operations basis. 9 Dividend per share relating to the interim and proposed final dividend. 10 Profit before tax divided by average shareholders’ funds. 11 The numerator is profit before interest, less tax. The denominator is the calculated average of net assets plus net debt plus dividend creditor less net assets held for sale. 12 Store sizes exclude lobby and restaurant areas. 13 Average store size excludes Express and One Stop stores. 15 Based on weighted average sales area and sales excluding property development. 18 Excluding 53 US stores and 22 Dobbies stores. Calculated on a 52 week basis, ROCE for 2008/9 is 12.8%. 21 Excluding 24 Dobbies stores. A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies are set  \\nout below. Exemptions\\nThe Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under \\nSection 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and not presented a Profit and \\nLoss Account for the Company alone. Recent accounting developments\\nStandards, amendments and interpretations adopted, following \\nnew amendments to FRS interpretations. These amendments permit the \\nreclassification of financial assets in particular circumstances. The adoption of the amendments to FRS 26 and FRS 29 has had  \\nno impact on the results or net assets of the Company. Current asset investments\\nThese relate to money market deposits which are stated at cost. All income \\nfrom these investments is included in the Profit and Loss Account as \\ninterest receivable and similar income. Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures\\nInvestments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are stated at cost less,  \\nwhere appropriate, provisions for impairment. Foreign currencies\\nAssets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Pounds \\nSterling at the financial year end exchange rates. The value of the charge is adjusted to \\nreflect expected and actual levels of vesting. Financial instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s \\nBalance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual \\nprovisions of the instrument. There are \\nno investments classified as held for trading. Gains and losses arising \\nfrom changes in fair value for available-for-sale investments are \\nrecognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is \\ndetermined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss \\npreviously recognised in equity is included in the net result for the period. Financial liabilities and equity  \\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to  \\nthe substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity \\ninstrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of \\nthe Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Creditors  \\nCreditors are non interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost. Equity instruments  \\nEquity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds \\nreceived, net of direct issue costs. Where derivatives do \\nnot qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement \\nare immediately recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company is required  \\nto document from inception the relationship between the item being \\nhedged and the hedging instrument. This effectiveness \\ntesting is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains \\nhighly effective. Fair value hedging  \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when \\nthey hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a \\nrecognised asset or liability. The associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and \\nrecognised in the Profit and Loss Account in the same period or  \\nperiods during which the hedged transaction affects the Profit and  \\nLoss Account. The classification of the effective portion when recognised \\nin the Profit and Loss Account is the same as the classification of the \\nhedged transaction. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires  \\nor is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Net investment hedging  \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges \\nwhen they hedge the Company’s net investment in an overseas \\noperation. Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the Profit \\nand Loss Account. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included \\nin the Profit and Loss Account when the foreign operation is disposed of. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are recoverable. The Schedule VI requirements for Directors’ Remuneration are included within the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 64. Note 4 Dividends\\nFor details of equity dividends see note 8 in the Group financial statements. The maximum indexation of the principal in any one year is 5%, with a minimum of 0%. (d) The 1.982% RPI MTN is redeemable at par, indexed for increases in the RPI over the life of the MTN. The excess of the consideration over the nominal value has been charged to retained earnings. The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at the meetings  \\nof the Company. However, if an irrevocable agreement is signed between the Company and a third party, \\nthey can continue to buy back shares on behalf of the Company. A liability  \\nof £100m was recognised within other payables for this amount. There were no such agreements in place in 2009. Capital redemption reserve\\nUpon cancellation of the shares purchased as part of the share buy-back, a capital redemption reserve is created representing the nominal value of the \\nshares cancelled. This is a non-distributable reserve. These parent company financial statements \\nhave been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.

What  \\nI would say is that it looks as if things are \\nstabilising on the consumer front. In Asia it is too early \\nto say. Their decline came later with the  \\ndestocking of the supply chain and so for \\nthem it really hit around December. These \\nare strong economies and the destocking \\nwill end and we’ll start to get restocking in \\nthe pipeline which will help. Tesco has to help \\ncustomers change from mass consumption \\nto green consumption. Q: It has been a very tough time for the \\neconomy but the good news is it has \\nbeen very sturdy growth for Tesco. How have you managed that? We’ve \\ninvested into this slowdown and that has \\ngiven us good momentum through the \\nrecession. In addition to that, of course, \\npeople have to eat – we’re blessed in that \\nsense, so we don’t face the worst of the \\nslowdown. We have got great \\nplans and we are making great progress. Q: Bearing in mind what you have seen \\nin the US so far, are you pleased with \\nthe progress? A: I am, yes, because there’s lots to be \\npleased about. Fresh & Easy is more \\nthan just a niche retailer – it’s a new and \\ndifferent form of retailing. The \\noperation is very good and it’s strong. We are \\nexpanding the business at a good rate and \\nmorale is high. Q: What excites you most about the \\nyear ahead? A: First of all we’re growing – and we’re \\nserving more customers. They have needs; \\nthey are just different needs at a time like \\nthis. It’s what Tesco is for – to stay close  \\nto customers and change as their needs \\nchange. That’s got to take a different form  \\nin different categories or in different parts  \\nof the world. I believe that is happening. There’s more that we have  \\nto do from place to place, but confidence is \\nhigh. People know what they have to do and \\nhave the authority to do it. Each of our markets is different so it’s up to \\nthe individual businesses to adjust their offer \\nlocally. Using customer insight allows our \\nexperienced teams on the ground to make \\ndecisions based on real customer data. Through careful analysis of  \\nsales and loyalty card data we can better \\nunderstand what is important to our \\ncustomers. We now make \\nsure that we are not beaten on price for \\nthese products. Across our markets customers are changing \\ntheir shopping habits as they are affected \\nto varying degrees by the global economic \\ndownturn. These changes \\nhave been well-received and consequently \\ncustomer numbers per store are up by \\nmore than a third. Whilst it is important to invest in the \\nshopping trip we are also continuing to \\ninvest for future growth. We also announced our entry into the \\nIndian market last year.

As we grow, \\nour customers increasingly look to \\nTesco to take the lead in these areas \\n– and we are. These good results are testament \\nto the hard work of our people. I would like to thank all \\nour people for their hard work which \\nI know will continue in the year ahead. We have continued to grow sales, \\nprofits and market share over the \\npast year. We’ve also significantly \\nstrengthened our balance sheet. I am also pleased to announce that we \\nagain increased our dividend – for the \\n26th consecutive year. This consistent \\ntrack record of delivering dividend \\ngrowth for shareholders is unrivalled \\nin the FTSE 100. T oday 65% of our selling space is \\noutside the UK. We are \\nsupporting the development of their Star Bazaar format. We plan to open our first cash and carry store by the \\nend of the year. In 2009/10 there were an additional 362 people working \\nin other locations such as international buying global hubs. Store numbers exclude one store in Calais, France. Total Revenue for Europe excludes France. Total Revenue for Asia excludes India. * Revenues are sales excluding VAT. And we’re \\nmaking good progress already. In International, our businesses have \\nmade good progress in a challenging \\nglobal economic environment. Our UK business had a good year. In Non-food we have made good \\nprogress. In the UK we achieved a \\nparticularly strong performance in \\nelectricals, entertainment and toys. Our Retailing Services have grown \\nsales and profits once again. By staying focused \\non doing the right thing for \\ncustomers we have weathered \\nthe economic storm well. Long-term strategy\\nTesco has a well-established and \\nconsistent strategy for growth. It was laid down in 1997, with the \\nfifth element – Community – being \\nadded in 2007. Importantly, the strategy has \\ngiven the business momentum to \\ngrow well through the economic \\ndownturn. Sales Trading profit\\nRegional results\\nSales up Trading\\nprofit up \\nNew space\\n5. We are partnering with investors to \\nshare the capital commitment on some \\nof these projects, enabling us to roll out \\nmore sites faster. Asia\\nWe have delivered a strong \\nperformance in Asia despite \\nchallenging economic conditions in \\nthe region. In International we have delivered \\na resilient performance in the \\nface of challenging economic \\nheadwinds. Our strategy is \\nworking – and we ended this year \\nstronger than we started it. In 2009/10 we opened 5.1m sq ft \\nof new space and in 2010/11 we will \\nopen 8.5m sq ft in addition to nine \\nshopping malls in China. We have \\ncontinued to invest through the \\ndownturn to ensure that we will be \\nin an even stronger position as the \\neconomies recover. Our strategy is to expand into less \\ndeveloped second and third tier cities \\nby opening hypermarkets in leading \\nshopping malls. South Korea also opened 63 \\nnew stores in the year. The acquisition \\nin 2008 has helped Homeplus grow \\nits market share and close the gap \\nwith the market leader. We opened \\nour first franchise store in February \\n2010 with more scheduled to open \\nin this financial year. South Korea is \\nour largest international business \\nwith sales of £4.5bn and profits of \\nalmost £300m. China\\nIn China, we are laying the \\nfoundations for long-term growth, \\nwith further investments in new \\nstores, supply chain infrastructure \\nand management. We have focused \\non three regions – each with its own \\nmanagement team – and with a focus \\non expansion into second and third \\ntier cities. We plan to open 23 hypermarkets in \\n2010/11 of which nine will be in new \\nLifespace malls. The mall development \\nprogramme will be funded in part \\nthrough joint ventures with third-party \\ninvestors. We continue to invest in Clubcard with \\nmore than one million customers \\nsigned up and with a dunnhumby \\nteam working with us locally to \\nprovide insight on pricing, range and \\npromotions. Our team in Japan continues to \\nmake good progress in developing \\nthe business. India \\nOur early plans in India are progressing \\nwell. Overall, however, the \\nsales trends are now improving; each \\nof our European businesses showed \\nan improvement in like-for-like sales \\ngrowth in the fourth quarter. Profitability in the \\nregion as a whole declined slightly \\ncompared with last year but was \\nresilient given the severity of recession. The \\ncost of the exceptional restructuring \\nactivities was £33m in total for \\nthe year. The outstanding category in non-\\nfood has been clothing with double-\\ndigit sales growth. Our flagship My \\nNarodni department store in Prague \\nwas reopened after a major refit \\nproject and we are pleased with the \\nresults to date. Although we do not expect losses to \\nbe much lower in 2010/11 we believe \\nthey have now peaked. This is the \\nfirst of its type in Central Europe. With \\nthe economy showing early signs of \\nrecovery we are planning to resume \\na faster rate of expansion this year. Clubcard –\\n15 years of loyalty\\nClubcard is our unique way of saying thank you \\nto our customers for shopping with us. Launched \\nin 1995, Clubcard now has 15 million active \\nmembers in the UK. This year Clubcard became even more rewarding. By increasing our investment with Double Points, \\ncustomers earned £550m in total in vouchers. We now have \\nClubcard in seven of our international markets \\n– in fact we now have more Clubcard holders \\noverseas than in the UK. Our UK business delivered a solid \\nperformance in competitive \\nmarket conditions. We are \\ngrowing faster than the industry \\nas a whole and we have achieved \\nthis by remaining focused – as \\nalways – on customers. Service\\nService remains a key differentiator. We continue to \\ninnovate our range with over 2,600 \\nnew or improved own-label food lines \\nlaunched this year. That’s why we’ve launched three \\ninnovative and popular iPhone apps. Customers no longer have to worry \\nabout forgetting their Clubcard as \\nour latest app enables them to scan \\ntheir Clubcard on their iPhone. This app is proving extremely popular \\nwith customers with over 200,000 \\ndownloads in the first three weeks \\nand there will soon be versions for \\nother smartphones too. Coming soon is another tesco.com \\napp which will enable customers to do \\ntheir tesco.com grocery ordering from \\ntheir phone. That’s why we have \\nbeen investing in our fresh food offer \\nwith a wide-ranging change \\nprogramme. Step Change\\nOur UK Step Change programme \\nis in its thirteenth year and continues \\nto go from strength to strength. This year we met our £550m savings \\ntarget. New space\\nThrough the experience and \\nexpertise of our property teams we \\nhave developed over a number of \\nyears a good pipeline of new space \\nopportunities. As a result we have \\nthe opportunity to unwind some of \\nthe work-in-progress we have built \\nup and will be stepping up the rate \\nof expansion in 2010/11. Sales\\nUK\\n£9.0bn\\nInternational\\n£4.1bn\\nOur non-food performance has \\nbeen very resilient through the \\ndownturn. We \\nnow sell one in every six microwaves \\nin the UK and one in four small-screen \\nTVs. Our sales in electricals have \\ndoubled in the last four years and \\naround 20% are online. Toys\\nOur sales in toys have grown 25% \\nthis year with online sales up more \\nthan 60%. F&F launched in the UK in 2001 and has \\nexpanded rapidly since then with sales \\nlast year of £540m in the UK – supported \\nby the launch of our online clothing site \\nin October. F&F launched in Central Europe in 2008 \\nand we’re already making excellent \\nprogress. We’re now building on the success in the \\nUK and Central Europe to launch F&F \\nacross our Asian markets. This year we \\nlaunched in China, Malaysia, South Korea \\nand Thailand. As with any brand, F&F can’t afford to \\nstand still, which is why we’re broadening \\nthe brand’s appeal with new ranges – \\nF&F Couture and F&F Jewellery. International clothing\\nClothing is becoming a global \\nstrength and a good example of how \\nwe are bringing global scale and skill \\nto our international businesses. With an \\nintegrated multichannel approach \\nwe’re making it easy for customers, \\nwhichever way they want to shop. t e s c o . The site became one of the top \\nten most visited clothing websites \\nwithin weeks of its launch. Customers are now able to buy \\na CD, DVD or game and a film \\nor album download, all in one \\ntransaction. From the outset the \\nnew website has proved popular \\nwith customers. It continues to grow strongly – last year we \\ndelivered over one billion items. Tesco Direct extends the reach of our non-food \\noffer with over 15,500 products available to \\ncustomers via the internet and catalogues. Customers can choose to have goods delivered to \\ntheir home or they can pick them up at one of our \\n261 in-store Direct desks. Bad debt levels \\nrose during the year but have now \\nstabilised and throughout have \\nremained below industry averages. We have absorbed additional costs as \\nwe begin the process of moving the \\nbusiness onto its own infrastructure \\nand build the team as we prepare the \\nbusiness for faster growth. Our 130 in-store travel \\nbureaux saw an increase in \\ntransactions of more than 80% \\nand the number of ATMs in our \\nnetwork grew to over 2,800. Trading profit was up 13.1% to £250m \\n(compared to £221m in 2008/9 on a \\npro forma basis). Capital and liquidity\\nThe Tier 1 capital ratio at the end \\nof 2009/10 was 13.0%. The funding \\nand liquidity position of the business \\nremained robust throughout the \\nperiod with customer deposits in \\nexcess of customer lending. All \\nsenior roles have now been filled. We have also selected the \\ncore technology platforms for the \\nbanking products. The migration \\nprogrammes for both sides of the \\nbusiness are progressing well and we \\nexpect to be writing business on the \\nnew systems by the end of 2010/11. In a little over a decade we have built \\na substantial profitable business that \\nhas sales of £2.1bn and employs \\n20,000 people. Our website is the \\nthird most visited retail website in the \\nUK and last year our online grocery \\nbusiness delivered over a billion items. Tesco Direct extends the reach of our \\nnon-food offer to customers via the \\ninternet, by phone and catalogues. Customers can choose to have goods \\ndelivered to their home or they can \\npick them up at one of our 261 in-\\nstore Direct desks. Tesco Mobile remained the \\nnumber one pay-as-you-go operator \\nfor customer satisfaction throughout \\n2009. The Phone Shops are \\ntransforming our ability to sell \\nproducts that require an assisted sale \\n– particularly contract mobile phones. dunnhumby\\nThis year marks dunnhumby’s 20th \\nanniversary. dunnhumby now \\ntouches the lives of over 350 million \\nconsumers through its client \\nrelationships. T esco Mobile \\nNo. The store emits \\nzero net CO\\n2\\n in its operations. The building is designed to use as little energy \\nas possible. The frame is made from sustainably \\nsourced wood, which requires much less energy \\nto produce than steel. We use roof windows and \\nsun pipes to bring natural daylight flooding into \\nthe customer and staff areas. Any energy that the store does need is generated \\nby a combined heat and power plant on site, \\nwhich is powered from renewable sources. We \\nsell any excess electricity to the National Grid. This is something \\nour customers expect and we \\nbelieve is increasingly important \\nfor our growth. We have delivered on our promise \\nto divert 100% of store waste in the \\nUK from going directly to landfill. The SCI aims to answer \\nsome of the fundamental questions \\nabout how to make a consumer \\nsociety sustainable. Customers tell us \\nthat being part of a local community \\nis important to them and they look \\nto us to play an active role. Being at \\nthe heart of successful, thriving \\nneighbourhoods is not just in the \\ninterest of our customers. It is in our \\ninterest too. We aim to use our size \\nas a force for good in society. Once again \\nwe have donated the equivalent of \\nmore than 1% of our profits to good \\ncauses. We have continued to roll out \\nCommunity Champions right across \\nthe Group. Community Champions \\nare staff members who dedicate paid \\nhours to coordinate store activities in \\ntheir local communities. The Champions \\nsupport local charities, organisations, \\nschools and causes that local people \\nreally care about. We now have \\nChampions in seven countries. In the US, we ran our ‘Shop for \\nSchools’ project for a second year. The first year \\nof the project helped raise over \\nUS$130,000 for schools in California, \\nArizona and Nevada, with the school \\nthat raised the most money in each \\nstate receiving a US$5,000 bonus. In Turkey, our Computers for Schools \\nprogramme distributed 264 products \\nincluding computers, printers and \\nprojectors to 60 schools. In Poland, \\nmore than 600 schools took part in \\nour Tesco for Schools programme, \\nan environmental contest for schools \\nwhere children create a piece of art \\nwith an environmental theme. This is not \\njust the right thing to do, it is also in \\nour business interest. We know that \\nif you treat people decently they \\nperform better. This approach also \\nhelps to improve the sustainability \\nof our supply chain. In 2009, over 3,300 suppliers covering \\nall our markets responded to our \\nGroup-wide anonymous supplier \\nsurvey – Supplier Viewpoint. At Tesco product safety is of \\nparamount importance. We have a \\nteam of over 900 technical specialists \\nworking to raise standards in our \\nsupplier base around the world. They help ensure that all our products \\n– from tagliatelle to TVs – are safe, \\nlegal, ethical and of the highest \\nquality for our customers. They are also concerned \\nabout the environmental impact \\nof the products they buy. In the UK, \\nwe have dedicated local buying, \\nmarketing and technical teams in \\neach of our regional buying offices. We stock more than 4,000 local \\nlines and work with over 400 local \\nand national suppliers. We’re also \\ndoing more local buying in our \\ninternational businesses. For example, \\nin Poland, we sell more than 6,000 \\nregional products. We aim to provide better \\ninformation on the nutritional value \\nof products so customers can make \\ninformed choices to improve their \\nhealth. This year we \\nsucceeded in getting 6.2 million \\npeople active across the world. Creating good jobs and careers\\nWe are dedicated to creating good \\njobs wherever we are. However, we also understand the importance of \\nsharing knowledge and experience around the \\nGroup. Each year we recruit a small number of high-\\npotential graduates who are fluent in both English \\nand Mandarin. As with all our graduates, we are committed to \\nequipping these individuals with both the \\ntechnical and leadership skills they will need to \\nprogress through the business. This unique scheme has been running for four \\nyears now and is gaining a strong reputation \\namongst university leavers. Last year we attracted \\nalmost 1,000 applicants for just 12 places. Previous \\nyears’ graduates have gone on to managerial roles \\nacross a variety of functions in China. These values are interlinked and \\nunderpin everything we do at \\nTesco. We know that by managing \\nour people well – in a culture of \\ntrust and respect – they will in turn \\ntry their hardest for customers. Rewards and benefits\\nOur people are crucial to our \\nsuccess and it is essential that \\nthey feel rewarded for the work \\nthey do and supported in their \\ndevelopment. Despite the tough global market in \\n2009 we continued to invest in pay \\nat the annual review. We focused \\non our core rates and in a tough \\nfinancial year our pay competitiveness \\nimproved in most markets. In Malaysia, for example, where there \\nis no legal minimum wage, the \\nminimum a Tesco employee will \\nreceive is 30% more than the Poverty \\nLine Index. In Thailand this year we \\nintroduced a staff discount linked \\nto Clubcard. In the UK, our reward package leads \\nthe market on pay and benefits. We regularly offer \\nstaff the opportunity to experience \\nour brand. Through share ownership and share \\nincentive schemes, 195,000 of our \\npeople have a personal stake in Tesco. Employees were awarded shares \\nworth a record £98m last May \\nthrough our Shares In Success \\nscheme. Last year we had more people on \\ndevelopment programmes than \\never before. We have continued to develop our \\napprenticeship training in the UK. The first 17 students to complete the \\nTesco Foundation Degree graduated \\nin July. We now have 60 people on the \\nscheme and are working on ways to \\nmake it grow. We believe that even in difficult times \\nit is essential to invest in future talent. The Tesco Academy helps provide an \\nopportunity to get on for all our \\npeople. It develops thousands of \\nworld-class leaders through excellent \\ntraining in leadership, management \\nand technical skills. The \\nnew Academy will help ensure that \\nthe development of our people in \\nAsia keeps pace with the rapidly \\ngrowing business. In the UK, our European Academy \\nprovides a hub to bring our managers \\nand directors from around the world \\nto the UK. The aim is to \\ndevelop confident leaders and create \\na community of experts. We now have 480 people at Director \\nlevel in the business. We also understand the importance \\nof increasing mobility. The first intake graduated \\nearlier this year. By July all will have \\nbeen promoted, with two thirds \\nworking outside the UK. Whistle-blowing\\nOur whistle-blowing policy and \\nhelpline is now in place in all countries. ‘Protector Line’ is a 24-hour \\nconfidential telephone line and email \\naddress for employees to raise ethical \\nissues and also report grievances. All calls are logged and investigated \\nby the appropriate function and all \\nserious matters are brought to the \\nattention of the CEO. The feedback \\nis monitored by the compliance \\ncommittee in each business. In 2009 we received around 1,700 \\nemployment-related calls to the \\nhelpline across the Group. Most calls relate to \\npersonnel issues, commercial issues, \\nsecurity and trading law. Personnel \\nissues are referred back to the store or \\nresolved through grievance procedures. Three women in Tesco are currently \\nbeing coached as part of the FTSE \\n100 Cross-Company Mentoring \\nProgramme. The mentors guide and advise \\nwomen in the management of their \\ncareers so that they are better \\npositioned to be considered for board \\nappointments.

It therefore enables the business to be operated and monitored \\non a balanced basis with due regard to the needs of all stakeholders. It is a measure of profit generation from sales and is a comparable \\nperformance measure with other companies.

Group sales, including VAT, increased by 6.8% to £62.5bn. Underlying profit before tax rose to £3,395m, an increase of 10.1%. Group operating profit rose by 10.7% to £3,457m. Group profit \\nbefore tax increased 10.4% to £3,176m. Net debt has \\nconsequently reduced by £1.7bn to £7.9bn. Group capital expenditure was £3.1bn (last year £4.7bn). This year we plan to invest around £3.5bn in \\ncapital expenditure. A reduction in the underlying interest \\ncharge is expected next year. We expect the tax rate \\nin 2010/11 to be around 26%. Property We are continuing to release value created through the long-\\nterm development of our property portfolio. In the year we completed \\ndeals with total proceeds of £1.8bn and we expect to divest a similar \\namount this year. Profits from property in the year were \\n£377m.

A successful risk management \\nprocess balances risks and rewards and relies on a sound judgement of \\ntheir likelihood and consequence. The key risks faced by the \\nGroup and relevant mitigating factors are set out below. Business strategy If our strategy follows the wrong direction or is not \\neffectively communicated then the business may suffer. Our strategy is based on  \\nfive elements: to become a successful international retailer, to grow the \\ncore UK business, be as strong in non-food as in food, develop retailing \\nservices and put the community at the heart of what we do. The risks associated with operating \\nTesco Bank are covered under Financial services risks below. The function has \\nclear policies and operating parameters, and its activities are routinely \\nreviewed and audited. The function does not operate as a profit centre and \\nthe undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. Tesco Bank is subject to significant legislative and regulatory oversight. Tesco Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesco on 19 December \\n2008. In preparation for this change its risk management and treasury \\ncapabilities were materially strengthened. All policies pertaining to risk \\nwithin the Bank are now subject to Tesco Bank specific governance \\nprocedures which are owned by the Tesco Bank Board. It has also developed a significant insurance business, with motor, \\nhome and pet insurance being the main products. Tesco Bank is subject to various risks associated with the provision of \\nfinancial services. In relation to its insurance business Tesco Bank may \\nexperience a concentration of risks from natural or man-made disasters. In addition market conditions may not allow it to purchase the amount  \\nof re-insurance it considers necessary on terms it considers acceptable. Actual claims may exceed the claims provisions that have been made on \\nthe basis of past experience. Tesco Bank is an FSA-regulated entity and so its treasury function is run \\nindependently from the rest of the Group. We manage the acquisition and development of our property  \\nassets carefully. Competition and consolidation The retail industry is highly competitive. People capabilities Employees are our greatest asset. We review our people policies \\nregularly and are committed to investing in training and development and \\nincentives for our people. Our ‘Talent Planning’ process helps individuals \\nachieve their full potential. We also carry out succession planning to ensure \\nthat the future needs of the business are considered and provided for. We take a proactive approach \\nto encouraging diversity at all levels within the business. Reputational risk As the largest retailer in the UK, expectations of the \\nGroup are high. Failure to protect the Group’s reputation and brand could \\nlead to a loss of trust and confidence. Like other companies we must consider potential threats to our reputation \\nand the consequences of reputational damage. Since the launch  \\nof the Community Plan in 2006 we have demonstrated our commitment \\nto tackling a wide range of societal and environmental issues. Environmental strategy and policies are reviewed regularly by the \\nCorporate Responsibility Committee. Product safety The safety and quality of our products is of paramount \\nimportance to Tesco as well as being essential for maintaining customer \\ntrust and confidence. A breach of confidence could affect the size of our \\ncustomer base and hence financial results. We have detailed and established procedures for ensuring product \\nintegrity at all times, especially for our own-label products. There are  \\nstrict product safety processes and regular management reports. We  \\nwork in partnership with suppliers to ensure mutual understanding of  \\nthe standards required. We have clear processes for crisis \\nmanagement, pulling together expert teams should we need to respond \\nquickly on issues. Health and safety risks The safety of our staff and customers is of the \\nutmost importance to us. If we are unable to provide safe environments  \\nfor our staff and customers this could lead to injuries or loss of life. KPIs for health and safety help prevent incidents \\nand form an intrinsic part of our Steering Wheel across the business. Performance against these KPIs is reported quarterly. At the heart of our Values  \\nis our belief that we should treat people as we like to be treated and we \\nhave a responsibility to help workers in our supply chain enjoy fair labour \\nstandards. There is, however, a risk that any \\npart of the supply chain might not adhere to these high standards. We continue to operate  \\na comprehensive programme of audit improvements, including more \\nunannounced audits and an industry-leading Auditor Recognition \\nprogramme. We have also sought to involve more multi-stakeholder \\nrepresentatives on our audits to improve workforce engagement and \\nenable activists to see and give feedback on our approach. We work with \\nsuppliers to identify any problems and, where they exist, support suppliers \\nin taking action to improve standards for their workers. Fraud and compliance As the business grows in size and geographical \\nspread, the risk of the occurrence of fraudulent behaviour by our \\nemployees increases. The Group takes extensive steps to reduce this risk. The Group gives \\nclear guidance on behaviour to employees through the Tesco Values and \\nthe Group Code of Business Conduct. The complexity of many of our property developments is increasing, \\nespecially the growing number of malls and mixed-use schemes. We also \\nhave to comply with design and construction standards which vary \\nsignificantly from country to country. IT systems and infrastructure The business is dependent on efficient \\ninformation technology (IT) systems. Any significant failure in the IT \\nprocesses of our retail operations (e.g. barcode scanning or supply chain \\nlogistics) would impact our ability to trade. We recognise the essential  \\nrole that IT plays across our operations in allowing us to trade efficiently \\nand achieve commercial advantage through implementing IT innovations  \\nthat improve the shopping trip for customers and make life easier for \\nemployees. We may also \\nbe impacted by political developments and the economic environment in \\nthe countries in which we operate. We consider these uncertainties in the \\nexternal environment when developing strategy and reviewing performance. We remain vigilant to future changes. Pension risks The Group’s pension arrangements are an important part \\nof our employees’ overall benefits package. We see them as a strong \\ncontributor to our ability to attract and retain good people. The Group has \\nconsidered its pension risks and has taken action by reducing risk in  \\nits investment strategy. These risks are managed as described below. The Group Balance Sheet position at 27 February 2010 is representative  \\nof the position throughout the year. The \\nobjective is to ensure continuity of funding. Tesco Group \\nhas a long-term rating of A3 with a negative outlook by Moody’s and A-  \\nby Standard & Poor’s. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, \\ncaps and collars are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating \\nrate debt. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate \\nform. Foreign currency risk management Our principal objective is to reduce \\nthe effect of exchange rate volatility on short-term profits. We \\nhedge the majority of our investments in our international subsidiaries via \\nforeign exchange transactions in matching currencies. We translate overseas profits at average foreign \\nexchange rates which we do not currently seek to hedge. The Group’s positions with  \\nthese counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. Tesco Insurance Limited covers Assets and Earnings, \\nwhile Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability. These statements should be \\ntreated with caution due to the inherent risks and uncertainties underlying \\nany such forward-looking information. The Group also provides retail banking and insurance services \\nthrough its subsidiary Tesco Bank. Group profit before tax increased by \\n£259m, to £3,176m. Profit for the year was £2,336m, of which £2,327m \\nwas attributable to equity holders of the parent company. No shareholder \\nholds securities carrying special rights with regards to control of the \\nCompany and there are no restrictions on voting rights. Voting rights and rights of acceptance of any offer relating to the \\nshares held in these trusts rests with the trustees, who may take account of \\nany recommendation from the Company. Voting rights are not exercisable \\nby the employees on whose behalf the shares are held in trust. Articles of Association The Company’s Articles of Association may only \\nbe amended by special resolution at a General Meeting of the shareholders. The biographical details of the present Directors  \\nare set out on pages 36 and 37 of this Report. At no time during the year did any of the Directors have a material interest \\nin any significant contract with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Employment policies The Group depends on the skills and commitment \\nof its employees in order to achieve its objectives. All \\ndecisions are based on merit. Internal communications are designed  \\nto ensure that employees are well informed about the business of the \\nGroup. Political and charitable donations Cash donations to charities \\namounted to £31,221,573 (2009 – £28,278,867). There were no political donations (2009 – £nil). Supplier payment policy Tesco PLC is a signatory to the Prompt \\nPayment Code. More information about the Code can be found at  \\nwww.promptpaymentcode.org.uk. Payment terms and conditions are \\nagreed with suppliers in advance. Tesco PLC has no trade creditors on  \\nits Balance Sheet. The Group pays its creditors on a pay on time basis \\nwhich varies according to the type of product and territory in which the \\nsuppliers operate. Events after the Balance Sheet date \\nThere were no material events after the Balance Sheet date. Auditors A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as \\nauditors of the Company and the Group will be proposed at the Annual \\nGeneral Meeting. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in \\naccordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. Corporate governance\\nDirectors’ report on corporate governance\\nTesco PLC is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance \\nas we recognise that strong governance is crucial in helping the business  \\nto deliver its strategy, generating shareholder value and safeguarding our \\nshareholders’ long-term interests. This is formalised in the Group Code of Business Conduct which sets out \\nour expectations of employees clearly. Where the provisions have not been complied with \\ncompanies must provide an explanation for this. The Board recognises the importance of a \\nbalanced board with an appropriate level of independence. Further information on the Combined Code can be found at\\xa0www.frc.org.uk. Rodney Chase is Deputy Chairman and Senior \\nIndependent Director. The size of the Board is appropriate given the \\ndiverse markets the business operates in and the breadth of operations \\nand services offered in each market. The structure of the Board and the integrity of the individual Directors ensure \\nthat no single individual or group dominates the decision making process. Biographies for the Directors can be found on pages 36 and 37 of this report. The Chairman\\nClear divisions of accountability and responsibility exist and operate \\neffectively for the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive. Senior Independent Director\\nThe Board has appointed one Non-executive Director, Rodney Chase,  \\nto act as Senior Independent Director. The independence of each Non-executive Director is assessed at least \\nannually. The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-executive Directors are \\navailable for inspection at the Company’s registered office. Board responsibilities\\nThe Board held 8 meetings in the year. It also held a two day off-site \\nmeeting which considered the Group’s strategy. The Board delegates to management the detailed planning and \\nimplementation of these matters in accordance with appropriate risk \\nparameters. The Company provides insurance cover and \\nindemnities for its Directors and officers. It is expected that all Directors attend \\nBoard and relevant Committee meetings, unless they are prevented from \\ndoing so by prior commitments, and that all Directors will attend the AGM. Directors leave the meeting where \\nmatters relating to them, or which may constitute a conflict of interest  \\nto them, are being discussed. These Committees are properly \\nauthorised under the constitution of the Company to take decisions and \\nact on behalf of the Board within the parameters laid down by the Board. The Board is kept fully informed of the work of these Committees and any \\nissues requiring resolution are referred to the full Board as appropriate. A summary of the operations of these Committees is set out below. A copy of each Committee’s \\nTerms of Reference is available on our website www.tesco.com/boardprocess. The Board is serviced by the Company Secretary, who reports to the \\nChairman in respect of his core duties to the Board. Where matters discussed relate to the Chairman, the Senior Independent \\nDirector chairs the meeting. The Nominations Committee met formally once in the year to discuss  \\nthe ongoing shape and capability of the Board. There were also a number \\nof ad hoc meetings during the year. Individual members of the Committee were involved during the year  \\nin interviewing candidates for Board and senior executive positions. At the invitation of the Committee, the Chairman of the Board normally \\nattends meetings and the Chief Executive attends as appropriate. The Committee met seven times this year. Each year it conducts a review \\nof the Committee’s own effectiveness and its Terms of Reference. The Committee met formally four times this year. There was also an \\nadditional ad hoc meeting. Each \\nyear the Committee conducts a review of its own effectiveness and its \\nTerms of Reference. Training is also provided to meet \\nspecific individual needs of Committee members. A number of other senior executives also  \\nattend the Committee and their valuable operational experience helps \\nbroaden the debate. Their attendance facilitates the communication  \\nof the Committee’s decisions to the rest of the Group. The Company \\nSecretary attends in his capacity as Secretary of the Committee. Procedures to deal with Directors’ conflicts of interest\\nThe Company has procedures in place to deal with the situation where  \\na Director has a conflict of interest. Directors also receive an induction to those Board Committees he or she  \\nwill serve on. Board performance evaluation \\nThe performance of the Board is a fundamental component of the Group’s \\nsuccess. The Board regularly reviews its own performance. This \\nassessment was co-ordinated and directed by the Chairman with the \\nsupport of the Company Secretary. The Chief Executive reviews the performance of each Executive Director. The Chairman reviews the performance of the Chief Executive and each \\nNon-executive Director. The Senior \\nIndependent Director met with the Non-executive Directors, in the absence \\nof the Chairman, to assess the Chairman’s performance. Risk management and internal controls \\nAccountabilities \\nAccepting that risk is an inherent part of doing business, our risk \\nmanagement systems are designed both to encourage entrepreneurial \\nspirit and also provide assurance that risk is fully understood and managed. Executive \\nmanagement is responsible for implementing and maintaining the \\nnecessary control systems. This ensures that all our people \\nunderstand what is expected of them and that decision-making takes \\nplace at the appropriate level. We recognise that our people may face \\nethical dilemmas in the normal course of business so we provide clear \\nguidance based on the Tesco Values. The Values set out the standards  \\nthat we wish to uphold in how we treat people. We operate a balanced scorecard approach that is known within the  \\nGroup as our Steering Wheel. The Steering \\nWheel operates at all levels throughout the Group. It enables the business \\nto be operated and monitored on a balanced basis with due regard for  \\nall stakeholders. Risk management \\nThe Group maintains a Key Risk Register. Where our risk management process identifies \\nopportunities to improve the business these are built into our future plans. Our key risks are summarised on pages 41 to 44 of the Business Review. The same process also applies \\nfunctionally in those parts of the Group requiring greater oversight. We recognise the value of the ABI Guidelines on Responsible Investment \\nDisclosure and confirm that, as part of its regular risk assessment \\nprocedures, the Board takes account of the significance of SEE matters  \\nto the business of the Group. We recognise that a number of investors  \\nand other stakeholders take a keen interest in how companies manage \\nSEE matters and so we report more detail on our SEE policies and \\napproach to managing material risks arising from SEE matters and the \\nKPIs we use both on our website (www.tesco.com/cr2010) and in our \\nCorporate Responsibility Report 2010. Internal controls \\nThe Board is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and \\nfor reviewing the effectiveness of such a system. The CEOs of subsidiary businesses are required to certify by way of  \\nannual governance returns that appropriate governance and compliance \\nprocesses have been adopted. The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of internal controls and is \\nsatisfied that the controls in place remain appropriate. Monitoring \\nThe Board oversees the monitoring system and has set specific \\nresponsibilities for itself and the various committees as set out below. It \\nshould be understood that such systems are designed to provide reasonable, \\nbut not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. It undertakes a programme to address \\ninternal control and risk management processes with particular reference \\nto the Turnbull Guidance. The Head of Internal Audit also attends all Audit Committee meetings. Our policy in relation to the reappointment of the external \\nauditors is to consider their engagement and independence annually. Compliance Committee \\nMembership of the Compliance Committee includes three Executive \\nDirectors and members of senior management. Each business in the Group has a Compliance Committee \\ndesigned to ensure compliance with both local and Group policies, and \\neach Compliance Committee reports to the Group Compliance Committee \\nat least once a year. The Corporate and Legal Affairs department and the Trading Law and \\nTechnical department provide assurance and advice on legal compliance, \\nhealth and safety, and SEE matters. These functions report on their work \\non a regular basis and escalate matters as appropriate. Such issues include illegal and unethical behaviour such as \\nfraud, dishonesty and any practices that endanger our staff, customers  \\nor the environment. Complaints made are treated as confidential and are investigated. Where \\nappropriate, matters will be escalated to the Director of Group Security  \\nfor further action. All major initiatives \\nrequire business cases normally covering a minimum period of five years. Post-investment appraisals, carried out by management, determine the \\nreasons for any significant variance from expected performance. Relations with stakeholders\\nWe are committed to having a constructive dialogue with stakeholders to \\nensure we understand what is important to them and allow ourselves the \\nopportunity to present our position. Engagement helps us identify new \\nrisks and opportunities to ensure that our long-term strategy is sustainable. In some instances we find that working with stakeholders in partnership \\ncan help deliver shared goals. We might not be able to satisfy all stakeholder \\nconcerns all the time but through engagement we can do our best to \\nbalance competing demands. We know that customers need to be able  \\nto trust our business and they will only trust us if they believe that we are \\nengaging on an appropriate basis with our stakeholders. We seek shareholder views on  \\na range of issues from strategy to corporate governance and SEE issues. We recognise the importance of communicating appropriately any \\nsignificant Company developments. The Chairman’s meetings with major shareholders \\ntook place independently from the Executive team. These \\nmeetings are attended as appropriate by Directors and other members  \\nof senior management. An Investor Relations report is produced for the Board periodically. All major presentations to institutional \\nshareholders are made available to private shareholders through the \\nTesco\\xa0PLC website. Our last Annual General Meeting  \\nin July 2009 was held in Glasgow. The 2010 AGM will be held in London  \\nat 10.30am on Friday 2 July. The whole Board attends the meeting and is available to answer questions \\nfrom shareholders present. To encourage shareholder participation, we \\noffer electronic proxy voting and voting through the CREST electronic \\nproxy appointment service. At our last Annual General Meeting, all \\nresolutions were voted by way of electronic poll. In doing  \\nso, Tesco has continued to build on the track record it has established  \\nover several years. Tesco is already a large and profitable company. It has therefore sought to ensure reward outcomes \\nare proportionate to Tesco’s performance outcome. We \\noperate in a keenly competitive and rapidly changing retail environment. Business success depends on the skills of each member of the key team, \\nbut outstanding business performance comes from teamwork. More than two-thirds of total remuneration (excluding pension) is linked  \\nto the performance of the business. If performance is lower than the maximum targets, incentive payments will \\nreduce accordingly and will be zero if threshold levels of performance are \\nnot attained. Shares held in plans which are not subject to forfeiture are included  \\nin this measurement. New appointees will typically be allowed three  \\nyears to establish this shareholding. Full participation in the long-term \\nPerformance Share Plan is conditional upon maintaining the minimum \\nshareholding. Excludes unexercised vested executive share options. Funding of equity awards\\nExecutive incentive arrangements are funded by a mix of newly issued \\nshares and shares purchased in the market. Where shares are newly issued \\nthe Company complies with ABI dilution guidelines on their issue. Currently \\nshares to be issued in respect of executive plans are equivalent to c.4% of \\nshares in issue. Fixed remuneration\\nBasic pay\\nBasic pay is designed to attract and retain talented individuals. ** Dividends accrue on these awards in the form of dividend equivalents. Over the last few years pension contributions by our Executive Directors \\nhave been increasing progressively. In 2009/10 the level of contribution \\nwas 8% of salary which is in line with senior management’s contribution \\nlevels. Contributions will rise over the next two years to 10% by 2011/12. Further details of the pension benefits earned by the Directors can be \\nfound on page 58. All employee share schemes\\nThe Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s all \\nemployee share schemes on the same terms as other UK employees. •   Shares In Success. •  Buy as You Earn. •  Save as You Earn. There are no performance conditions \\nattached to SAYE options. Other benefits\\nThe Executive Directors are eligible for car benefits, life assurance, \\ndisability and health insurance and staff discount. Performance against most targets was within \\nthe target range. The Remuneration Committee has assessed the bonus outturn for \\n2009/10 and Tim Mason has been awarded 65% of the potential \\nmaximum for both the cash and deferred shares elements of that part  \\nof his annual bonus which is measured by reference to US-specific targets. There is no re-testing of \\nperformance. Having considered these factors  \\nin detail the Committee concluded that all of the remaining 25% of the \\naward should vest. A total of 48.1% of the 2007/8 \\nPSP award measured on international performance will therefore vest. The same principles as described earlier were also adopted in the \\ndetermination of performance targets. Short-term performance targets\\nWe do not disclose specific future targets for reasons of commercial \\nsensitivity. Success \\nagainst these measures will contribute to building a strong platform for \\nlong-term sustainable growth of the US business. Performance against this target will be measured at the end of 2011/12  \\nto determine the level of vesting. There is no re-testing of performance in respect of any targets. The US CEO was made an award of two million shares under the US LTIP \\nin 2007. Awards were also made to other senior members of the US \\nmanagement team. No other Executive Directors will participate in the \\nPlan. Initially only the Group CEO will participate in the \\nGroup Plan. An \\naward of 2.5 million shares was made to the Group CEO in November 2007. Service agreements\\nThe Executive Directors all have rolling service agreements with no fixed \\nexpiry date. These contracts are terminated on notice of 12 months by  \\nthe Company and six months’ notice by the Executive. No account will be taken of pension. Termination \\npayments will be subject to mitigation. This means that amounts will  \\nbe paid in instalments to permit mitigation. If the termination occurs  \\nwithin one year of retirement, the termination payment will be reduced \\naccordingly. The Remuneration Committee has agreed that new appointments  \\nof Executive Directors will normally be on a notice period of 12 months. The Committee reserves the right to vary this period to 24 months for the \\ninitial period of appointment and for the notice period to then revert to \\n12\\xa0months. The service agreements are available to shareholders to view  \\non request from the Company Secretary. Such Non-executive duties \\ncan broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit Tesco. Fees \\nretained for any Non-executive directorships are set out below. The letters are available to \\nshareholders to view from the Company Secretary upon request. The Chairman meets with each Non-executive Director separately to \\nreview individual performance. The Chairs of the Audit and \\nRemuneration Committees receive £30,000 (in addition to their basic  \\nNon-executive fee) and Non-executive Directors who are members of \\nthese Committees receive an additional £12,000 for each Committee. The Remuneration \\nCommittee determines the Chairman’s remuneration, having regard to  \\ntime commitment and packages awarded to Chairmen of other companies \\nof a similar size and complexity. The Remuneration Committee\\nThe Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is governed by formal \\nTerms of Reference which are reviewed annually. The Directors’ \\nbiographies can be found on pages 36 and 37 of this Report. Jonathan Lloyd, the Company \\nSecretary, is Secretary to the Committee. They \\nare not present when their own remuneration is being discussed. The Chairman of the Group also attends the GOC and the \\nCompany Secretary serves as its secretary. The GOC reports its findings  \\nto the Remuneration Committee each year. The Remuneration Committee \\ntakes these into account, along with the view of the Audit Committee,  \\nto ensure that financial performance against targets is indicative of strong \\nand robust business performance. Compliance\\nIn carrying out its duties, the Remuneration Committee gives full \\nconsideration to best practice. This report also complies with \\ndisclosures required by the Director Remuneration Report Regulations \\n2002. Details of Directors’ emoluments and interests are set out on  \\npages 58 to 66 of this Report. Details of these awards are shown in table 6. 4  Ken Hanna was apppointed during the year. The figure in table 1 is from his date of appointment. The scheme also provides for dependants’ pensions and lump sums on death in service. The scheme is a \\ndefined benefit pension scheme, which is approved by HMRC. 2 Some of the Executive Directors’ benefits are payable from an unapproved pension arrangement. This is secured by a fixed and floating charge on a cash deposit. 5 Inflation over the year has been allowed for using the September 2009 statutory revaluation order. 2 Gains made on Save As You Earn share options are not included above. These are detailed in table 5. These are detailed in table 6 and table 9.

Joint ventures and associates\\nA joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long-\\nterm basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more \\nother venturers under a contractual agreement. Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group Balance \\nSheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net \\nassets of the entity, less any impairment in value. The carrying values of \\ninvestments in joint ventures and associates include acquired goodwill. The estimates and associated assumptions are \\nbased on historical experience and various other factors that are believed \\nto be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the \\nbasis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities \\nthat are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ \\nfrom these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing \\nbasis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in \\nwhich the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in \\nthe period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both \\ncurrent and future periods. The results for the 53 weeks ended 28 February 2009 have \\nbeen restated accordingly. The prior year effect \\nof the restatement on basic and diluted earnings per share is a reduction \\nof 0.36p per share, and 0.35p per share, respectively. Any other conditions are non-vesting conditions \\nwhich have to be taken into account to determine the fair value of the \\nequity instruments granted. The \\nresults for the year ended 28 February 2009 have been restated \\naccordingly. The Group has elected to present two \\nstatements: a Group Income Statement and a Group Statement of \\nComprehensive Income. The consolidated financial information has \\nbeen prepared under the revised disclosure requirements. There was  \\nno impact on the results or net assets of the Group. Revenue\\nRetailing\\nRevenue consists of sales through retail outlets. Commission income is recorded based on the terms of the contracts and  \\nis recognised when the service is provided. Financial Services\\nRevenue consists of interest, fees and commission receivable. Fees in respect of services are recognised on an accruals basis as service  \\nis provided. The arrangements are generally contractual and the cost of \\nproviding the service is incurred as the service is rendered. The price is \\nusually fixed and always determinable. Significant fee types include credit \\ncard related services fees such as interchange, late payment and balance \\ntransfer fees. The Group receives insurance commission from the sale of general \\ninsurance policies, which is dependent on the profitability of the underlying \\ninsurance policies. Computers for Schools and Sport for Schools and Club vouchers are issued \\nby Tesco for redemption by participating schools/clubs and are part of our \\noverall Community Plan. The cost of the redemption (i.e. meeting the \\nobligation attached to the vouchers) is treated as a cost rather than a \\ndeduction from sales. Dividends are recognised when a legal entitlement to receive \\npayment arises. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful \\nlives on the same basis as owned assets or, when shorter, over the term of \\nthe relevant lease. Qualifying assets are those that \\nnecessarily take a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended \\nuse. The depreciation \\npolicies for investment property are consistent with those described for \\nowner-occupied property. Leasing\\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease \\ntransfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis \\nover the term of the relevant lease. The corresponding \\nliability is included in the Group Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. Finance charges are charged to the \\nGroup Income Statement. Sale and leaseback\\nA sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an asset and \\nimmediately reacquires the use of that asset by entering into a lease with \\nthe buyer. Following initial recognition, the lease treatment is consistent with those \\nprinciples described above. Business combinations and goodwill\\nAll business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase \\nmethod. The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion \\nof the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised. The Group recognises intangible assets as part of business combinations at \\nfair value on the date of acquisition. The \\nuseful lives of intangible assets are estimated, and amortisation charged \\non a straight-line basis. a discount on acquisition) then the difference is credited to the Group \\nIncome Statement in the period of acquisition. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually by assessing the \\nrecoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill \\nrelates. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating \\nunit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement \\nand is not subsequently reversed. Internally-generated intangible assets – Research and development \\nexpenditure\\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating \\nunit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount \\nof the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as a \\ncredit to the Group Income Statement immediately. Other investments\\nOther investments in the Group Balance Sheet comprise loan receivable \\nand available-for-sale financial assets. Refer to the financial instruments \\naccounting policy for further detail. Loan receivables are recognised at amortised cost and available-for-sale \\nfinancial assets are recognised at fair value. Short-term investments\\nShort-term investments in the Group Balance Sheet consist of deposits \\nwith money market funds. Non-current assets held for sale\\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if \\ntheir carrying amount will be recovered through sale rather than \\ncontinuing use. Management must be committed to the sale \\nand it should be expected to be completed within one year from the date \\nof classification. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are \\nmeasured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Actuarial \\ngains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group Statement of \\nComprehensive Income. Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense \\nas they fall due. The value of the charge is adjusted  \\nto reflect expected and actual levels of vesting. Taxation\\nThe tax expense included in the Group Income Statement consists of \\ncurrent and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Group Income Statement except to the \\nextent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income  \\nor directly in equity, in which case it is recognised other comprehensive \\nincome or equity, respectively. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that \\ntaxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary \\ndifferences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance \\nsheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that \\nsufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to \\nbe recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there \\nis a legally enforceable right to set-off current taxation assets against \\ncurrent taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis. Foreign currencies\\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on \\nthe date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets \\nand liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at \\nthe rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to \\nthe Group Income Statement for the period. Such translation differences are \\nrecognised as income or expenses in the period in which the operation  \\nis disposed of. Trade receivables\\nTrade receivables are non interest-bearing and are recognised initially at \\nfair value, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nrate method, reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated \\nirrecoverable amounts. Investments\\nInvestments are recognised at trade date. Investments are classified as \\neither held for trading or available-for-sale, and are recognised at fair value. There are no investments classified as held for trading. Interest calculated using the effective interest rate method is \\nrecognised in the Group Income Statement. Loans and advances\\nLoans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or \\ndeterminable payments that are not quoted in an active market and \\ninclude amounts due from customers and amounts due from other banks. Loans and advances are initially \\nrecognised at fair value plus directly related transaction costs. Historical loss experience is \\nadjusted, on the basis of current observable data, to reflect the effects of \\ncurrent conditions not affecting the period of historical experience. Loan impairment provisions are established on a portfolio basis taking \\ninto account the level of arrears, security, past loss experience, credit \\nscores and defaults based on portfolio trends. The portfolios include credit card receivables and \\nother personal advances. Financial liabilities and equity instruments\\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to  \\nthe substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity \\ninstrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of \\nthe Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Trade payables\\nTrade payables are non interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost. Equity instruments\\nEquity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds \\nreceived, net of direct issue costs. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to \\ndocument from inception the relationship between the item being \\nhedged and the hedging instrument. This effectiveness \\ntesting is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge \\nremains highly effective. The classification of the effective portion when recognised in the Group \\nIncome Statement is the same as the classification of the hedged \\ntransaction. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires  \\nor is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge \\naccounting. Net investment hedging\\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges \\nwhen they hedge the Group’s net investment in an overseas operation. Any ineffective \\nelement is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement. Where the liability is in a currency other than Pounds Sterling, \\nthe liability has been designated as a net investment hedge. Any change in \\nthe value of the liability resulting from changes in exchange rates is \\nrecognised directly in equity. Where \\nmaterial, these leases are discounted to their present value. Provisions  \\nfor dilapidation costs are recognised on a lease by lease basis. The standard has been revised to \\nrequire capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to a \\nqualifying asset. The standard also specifies the accounting when control of \\nan entity is lost. All acquisition-related costs should be expensed. These measures \\nare used for internal performance analysis. Underlying profit is not defined \\nby IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other \\ncompanies’ adjusted profit measures. It is not intended to be a substitute \\nfor, or superior to IFRS measurements of profit. The Group believes these arrangements remain effective and \\neconomically and commercially viable hedges despite the inability  \\nto apply hedge accounting. The \\nunderlying profit measure removes this volatility to help better identify \\nunderlying business performance. The leases have been \\nstructured in a way to increase annual lease costs as the businesses \\nexpand. –  Restructuring costs – These relate to certain costs associated with \\nthe Group’s restructuring activities. There were no exceptional items in 2009. Previously, segments were determined and presented in accordance with IAS 14 \\n‘Segment Reporting’. Trading profit is a consistent measure within the Group. On the adoption of IFRS 8, the Group revised its operating and reporting segments. Comparative information has been restated to reflect these new segments. Segment assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated is comprised \\nmainly of derivative receivables, interest-bearing loan receivables and taxation-related assets. Inter-segment turnover between the operating segments is not material. Finance income of £20m (2009 – finance costs of £30m) resulted from hedge ineffectiveness. Taxation in other jurisdictions is calculated at \\nthe rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of £297m (2009 – £32m in \\n2013) that will expire in 2014 and £550m (2009 – £647m between 2014 and 2029) that will expire between 2015 and 2030. Other losses will be carried \\nforward indefinitely. It will be paid on 9 July 2010 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 1 May 2010. All operations are continuing for the years presented. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at \\nwhich management monitor that goodwill. In 2010, recoverable amounts  \\nare based on value in use. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience \\nand expectations of future changes in the market. The carrying amount for Japan has been reduced to its recoverable amount through the recognition of an impairment loss of £131m against goodwill. These discount rates are derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the specific \\nrisks relating to each geographical region. Interest capitalised  \\nis deducted in determining taxable profit in the year in which it is incurred. (f) Capital work in progress does not include land. Cash-generating units are tested for \\nimpairment if there are indications of impairment at the balance sheet date. Changes in selling prices \\nand direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market. These discount rates are derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital. In all cases, impairment losses arose due to \\nstores performing below forecasted trading levels. In all cases, impairment losses arose due to \\nthe malls performing below forecasted trading levels. This fair value has been determined by applying an appropriate \\nrental yield to the rentals earned by the investment property. A valuation has not been performed by an independent valuer. z o.o.

A full list  \\nof the Group’s subsidiary undertakings will be annexed to the next Annual Return filed at Companies House. This loan has no interest receivable \\nand no fixed repayment date. Included in available-for-sale financial assets is £224m, which is current. Credit terms vary by country and the nature of the debt and can be from 7 to 60 days. Trade receivables are recorded at amortised cost, reduced by estimated allowances for doubtful debts. The amount of the provision was £47m  \\n(2009 – £44m). Note 17 Loans and advances to customers \\nTesco Bank has loans and advances to customers. During 2009 the Group entered into a securitisation \\ntransaction and issued debt securities which the Group subsequently purchased. The purpose of the transaction was to allow the Group to enter into the \\nSpecial Liquidity Scheme whereby it would enter into a sale and repurchase agreement acquiring Treasury Bills issued by the UK Government and using \\nthe debt securities as security. The Treasury Bills do not \\nmeet the recognition criteria of IAS 39 and are not recognised on the Group Balance Sheet. Loan impairment provisions of £314m (2009 – £250m) were \\nheld against these loans. Overall trade and other payables increased to £7,359m. (b)  The 3.322% LPI MTN is redeemable at par, indexed for increases in the RPI over the life of the MTN. The maximum indexation of the principal in any one year is 5%, with a minimum of 0%. (c) The 1.982% RPI MTN is redeemable at par, indexed for increases in the RPI over the life of the MTN. Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes and the Group’s hedging policies are further described below. Finance income of £20m (2009 – finance costs of £30m) resulted from hedge ineffectiveness. Fair value hedges \\nThe Group maintains interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued \\nby the Group. Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, mark-to-market gains \\nand losses are deferred in equity. The hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars. Net investment hedges \\nThe Group uses forward foreign currency contracts, currency denominated borrowings and currency swaps to hedge the exposure of a proportion of its \\nnon-Sterling denominated assets against changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These instruments include caps, interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts. The above table excludes \\nother receivables/payables, which have fair values equal to their carrying values. These risks are managed as described below. The Group Balance Sheet position at  \\n27 February 2010 is representative of the position throughout the year. Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Interest rate risk\\nInterest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Debt issued at variable rates exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Debt issued at fixed \\nrates exposes the Group to fair value risk. Our interest rate management policy is explained on page 44. The Group has RPI debt where the principal is indexed to increases in the RPI index. RPI debt is treated as floating rate debt. The Group also has LPI \\ndebt, where the principal is indexed to RPI, with an annual maximum increase of 5% and a minimum of 0%. LPI debt is treated as fixed rate debt. For interest rate risk relating to Tesco Bank please refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors. The Group policy on credit risk is described on page 44. The counterparty exposure under derivative contracts is £1,474m (2009 – £1,860m). The Group policy is to transact derivatives only with counterparties \\nrated at least A1 by Moody’s. For credit risk relating to Tesco Bank please refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors on page 109. For liquidity risk relating to Tesco Bank please refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors on page 109. The undiscounted cash flows will differ from both the carrying values and fair value. Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the \\nbalance sheet date. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date. For index-linked liabilities, inflation is \\nestimated at 3% for the life of the liability. Transactional exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged. These exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges. The notional and fair value of these \\ncontracts is shown in note 22. •  Net investment exposure, from the value of net investments outside the UK. •  Loans to non-UK subsidiaries. These are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are not formally \\ndesignated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset. The impact on equity from changing exchange rates results principally from foreign currency deals used as net investment hedges. The impact on equity \\nwill largely be offset by the revaluation in equity of the hedged assets. The target for the value of share buy-backs was \\nincreased from £1.5bn to £3.0bn over a five-year period from April 2007. During 2009 the Group purchased and cancelled £100m ordinary shares. The policy for debt is to ensure a smooth debt maturity profile with the objective of ensuring continuity of funding. Tesco Bank policy seeks to minimise \\nthe sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed using interest rate swaps as the main hedging instrument. Limits have been established for all counterparties \\nbased on their respective credit ratings. Internal reporting and oversight of risk assets is principally differentiated by credit ratings. Internal ratings are used to assess the credit quality of \\nborrowers. Customers are assigned credit ratings, based on various credit grading models that reflect the probability of default. To meet regulatory requirements a diversified portfolio of high quality liquid and marketable assets is \\nmaintained. Cash flow commitments and marketable asset holdings are measured and managed on a daily basis. Insurance risk is the risk of fluctuations in the timing, frequency or severity of insured events, relative to the expectations at the time of underwriting. Property insurance \\nThe major causes of claims for property insurance are theft, flood, escape of water, fire, storm, subsidence and various types of accidental damage. The major source of uncertainty is the volatility of weather. Note 24 Customer deposits\\n          2010 2009\\n              £m £m\\nCustomer deposits            4,357 4,538\\nCustomer deposits are recorded at amortised cost and are repayable on demand. The majority of the provision is expected to be utilised over the period to 2020. The other provision balance relates to a provision for customer redress in respect of potential customer complaints. This is likely to be utilised over several years. Of this amount £241m (2009 restated – £208m) will be equity-settled and £59m (2009 – £38m) \\ncash-settled. iii)    The Approved Executive Share Option Scheme (1994) was adopted on 17 October 1994. There were \\nno discounted options granted under this scheme. iv)    The Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme (1996) was adopted on 7 June 1996. There were \\nno discounted options granted under this scheme. This scheme permits the grant to selected non-UK \\nexecutives of options to acquire ordinary shares on substantially the same basis as their UK counterparts. There \\nwere no discounted options granted under this scheme. vi)     The Executive Incentive Plan (2004) was adopted on 5 July 2004. This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected \\nexecutives. Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration. This scheme permits the grant of options in \\nrespect of ordinary shares to selected executives. Options granted before 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between four and ten years from \\nthe date of grant for nil consideration. Options granted after 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of \\ngrant for nil consideration. viii)  The Discretionary Share Option Plan (2004) was adopted on 5 July 2004. This scheme permits the grant of approved, unapproved and international \\noptions in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives. Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant at  \\na price not less than the middle-market quotation or average middle-market quotations of an ordinary share for the dealing day or three dealing days \\npreceding the date of grant. There will be no discounted options granted under this scheme. This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary \\nshares to selected executives. No assumption has been made to incorporate the effects of expected early exercise. Each year, shares are awarded as a percentage \\nof earnings up to a statutory maximum of £3,000. Eligible Republic of Ireland employees are able to participate in a Share Bonus Scheme, an all-\\nemployee profit sharing scheme. Each year, employees receive a percentage of their earnings as either cash or shares. The amount paid to employees is based on a percentage of salary and is \\npaid partly in cash and partly in shares. Selected senior management participate in the senior management Performance Share Plan. Full details \\nof these schemes can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. Towers Watson Limited, an independent actuary, carried out the latest triennial actuarial \\nassessment of the scheme as at 31 March 2008, using the projected unit method. At the date of the last actuarial valuation the actuarial deficit was £275m. The One Stop Scheme had a net liability of £4.6m at 28 February 2009. Overseas\\nThe most significant overseas scheme is the funded defined benefit pension scheme which operates in the Republic of Ireland. Towers Watson Limited have updated the most recent Republic of Ireland valuation. The main financial assumption is the real discount rate (the excess of the discount rate over the rate of price inflation). PFA92C00 for female members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be half a year older than actual age. The expected rate of return on equities and cash have both been set having regard to expected returns over the medium term, as \\ncalculated by the Company’s independent actuary. The expected rate of return on bonds was measured directly from actual yields for gilts and corporate \\nbond stocks. The purpose of the \\nvaluation is to agree a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities. The total \\nconsideration, including expenses, £100m. The excess of the consideration over the nominal value was charged to retained earnings. The owners of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at the meetings  \\nof the Company. Capital redemption reserve\\nUpon cancellation of the shares purchased as part of the share buy-back, a capital redemption reserve is created representing the nominal value  \\nof the shares cancelled. This is a non-distributable reserve. Purchases from related parties include £226m (2009 – £174m) of rentals payable to the Group’s joint ventures, including those joint ventures formed as \\npart of the sale and leaseback programme. Purchases from associates include £1,312m (2009 – £1,171m) of fuel purchased from Greenergy International Limited. The accounts for those partnerships have been consolidated into these accounts pursuant to Regulation 7 of the Regulations. The limited partnerships contain twelve stores and two \\ndistribution centres which have been sold from and leased back to the Group. The Group sold assets for net proceeds of £386m to the limited \\npartnership. On 23 September 2009, the Group formed a limited partnership with a third party. The limited partnerships contain fifteen stores and two distribution \\ncentres which have been sold from and leased back to the Group. The Group sold assets for net proceeds of £460m to the limited partnership. iii) Transactions with key management personnel\\nOnly members of the Board of Directors of Tesco PLC are deemed to be key management personnel. It is the Board who have responsibility for planning, \\ndirecting and controlling the activities of the Group. For details of assets held under finance leases, which are pledged as security for the finance lease liabilities, see note 11. There are a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business which if realised are not expected to result in a material liability  \\nto the Group. The Group recognises provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not a settlement will be required and the value of such a payment \\ncan be reliably estimated. The Group has however made no admission of wrongdoing. The amount is intended to provide an indication of the potential volume of business and not of the underlying credit or other risks. The FSCS meets its obligations by raising management expense levies. These include amounts to cover the interest on its borrowings and compensation \\nlevies on the industry. Each deposit-taking institution contributes in proportion to its share of total protected deposits. If the FSCS does not receive sufficient funds from the failed institutions to repay HM Treasury in full it will raise compensation levies. TPF has complied with the FSA’s capital requirements throughout the year. There are also a small number of buildings which are held \\nunder finance leases. The leases have varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights. The Group is not obliged to pay lease rentals after that date and so minimum lease payments exclude those falling after the buy-back date. Operating lease commitments with joint ventures \\nSince 1988, the Group has entered into several joint ventures and sold and leased back properties to and from these joint ventures. The Group reviews the substance  \\nas well as the form of the arrangements when making the judgement as to whether these leases are operating or finance leases; all of the leases under \\nthese arrangements are operating leases. Operating lease receivables – Group as lessor\\nThe Group both rents out its properties and also sublets various leased buildings under operating leases. Operating margin is based upon revenue excluding VAT. Periods before this date have not  \\nbeen restated. 4 Consists of the net result of the Taiwanese business which was sold during 2007. For further details of this measure, see page 81. 6 Results have been restated to reflect the US and Tesco Bank as separate segments. 7 Market capitalisation plus net debt. 8 Basic and diluted earnings per share are on a continuing operations basis. 9 Dividend per share relating to the interim and proposed final dividend. 10 Profit before tax divided by average shareholders’ funds. 11 The numerator is profit before interest, less tax.

Calculated on a 52-week basis, ROCE for 2009 is 12.8%. A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies are set  \\nout below. Exemptions\\nThe Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under \\nSection 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented a Profit and \\nLoss Account for the Company alone. Any other conditions \\nare non-vesting conditions which have to be taken into account to \\ndetermine the fair value of the equity instrument granted. The results for the year \\nended 28\\xa0February 2009 have been restated accordingly. Current asset investments\\nThese relate to money market deposits which are stated at cost. Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures\\nInvestments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are stated at cost less, where \\nappropriate, provisions for impairment. Foreign currencies\\nAssets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Pounds \\nSterling at the exchange rates at the end of the financial year. The value of the charge  \\nis adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting. There are  \\nno investments classified as held for trading. Financial liabilities and equity \\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the \\nsubstance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity \\ninstrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of the \\nCompany after deducting all of its liabilities. Creditors \\nCreditors are non interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost. Equity instruments \\nEquity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds \\nreceived, net of direct issue costs. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company is required to \\ndocument from inception the relationship between the item being hedged \\nand the hedging instrument. This effectiveness testing is \\nperformed at each period end to ensure that the hedge has remained \\nhighly effective. Fair value hedging \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when \\nthey hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a \\nrecognised asset or liability. The classification of the effective \\nportion when recognised in the Parent Company Profit and Loss Account  \\nis the same as the classification of the hedged transaction. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or \\nis sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Net investment hedging \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges \\nwhen they hedge the Company’s net investment in an overseas operation. Any \\nineffective element is recognised immediately in the Parent Company \\nProfit and Loss Account. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are recoverable. Recent accounting developments\\nStandards, amendments and interpretations adopted, following new \\namendments to FRS interpretations. The Schedule VI requirements for Directors’ remuneration are included within the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 66.

This consistent track record \\nof delivering dividend growth \\nfor shareholders is unrivalled in \\nthe FTSE 100. 53%\\nToday 65% of our selling space is \\noutside the UK. 65%\\nWe are committed to being carbon-\\nneutral by 2050 and helping our \\ncustomers halve their own carbon \\nfootprint by 2020. 1\\n48% of our space is less than \\nfive years old. We are  \\nsupporting the development of their Star Bazaar format. We plan to open our first cash and carry store by the  \\nend of the year. Store numbers exclude one store in Calais, France. Total Revenue for Europe excludes France. Total Revenue for Asia excludes India. *  Revenues are sales excluding VAT. In Non-food we have made good \\nprogress. In the UK we achieved a \\nparticularly strong performance in \\nelectricals, entertainment and toys. Our Retailing Services have \\ngrown sales and profits once \\nagain. And we’re making good  \\nprogress already. By \\nstaying focused on doing the \\nright thing for customers we \\nhave weathered the economic \\nstorm well. In International, our businesses \\nhave made good progress in a \\nchallenging global economic \\nenvironment. Our strategy is \\nworking – we’ve grown sales, \\nprofits and market shares and \\nwe’ve continued to invest in the \\ndrivers of future growth. Our UK business had a good year. Tesco has a well-established and \\nconsistent strategy for growth. It was laid \\ndown in 1997, with the fifth element – Community – being \\nadded in 2007. Importantly, the strategy has given the business momentum \\nto grow well through the economic downturn. In Asia, we have delivered a  \\nstrong performance despite \\nchallenging economic conditions  \\nin the region. Although we do not expect losses \\nto be much lower in 2010/11 we \\nbelieve they have now peaked. In International we have \\ndelivered a resilient performance \\nin the face of challenging \\neconomic headwinds. Our strategy is working –  \\nand we ended this year \\nstronger than we started it. In 2009/10 we opened 5.1m sq ft  \\nof new space and in 2010/11 we \\nwill open 8.5m sq ft in addition  \\nto nine shopping malls in  \\nChina. Our strategy is to expand into less \\ndeveloped second and third tier cities \\nby opening hypermarkets in leading \\nshopping malls. We are partnering with investors to share \\nthe capital commitment on some of \\nthese projects, enabling us to roll out \\nmore sites faster. Launched in 1995, \\nClubcard now has 15 million active \\nmembers in the UK. This year Clubcard became even more \\nrewarding. By increasing our investment \\nwith Double Points, customers earned \\n£550 million in total in vouchers. We now have \\nClubcard in seven of our international \\nmarkets – in fact we now have more \\nClubcard holders overseas than in  \\nthe UK. Quality – particularly in fresh food  \\n– remains important to customers \\neven in tough times and as we \\nemerge from recession this will \\nbecome even more important. That’s why we have been investing \\nin our fresh food offer with a  \\nwide-ranging change programme. We continue to innovate our range \\nwith over 2,600 new or improved \\nown-label food lines launched  \\nthis year. That’s \\nwhy we have continued to invest \\nin availability, service, range  \\nand quality. We understand how important  \\nit is to our customers that their \\nfavourite items are available every \\ntime they shop. Over the past year \\nwe have introduced a number of \\nnew initiatives to improve stock \\nmanagement and reduce further \\nthe number of gaps on our shelves. We’ve also stayed ahead of our \\ncompetitors on key customer \\nservice measures. F&F launched in the UK in 2001 and \\nhas expanded rapidly since then with \\nsales last year of £540 million in the  \\nUK – supported by the launch of our \\nonline clothing site in October. F&F launched in Central Europe in 2008 \\nand we’re already making excellent \\nprogress. We’re now building on the success in \\nthe UK and Central Europe to launch \\nF&F across our Asian markets. This year \\nwe launched in China, Malaysia, South \\nKorea and Thailand. As with any brand, F&F can’t afford to \\nstand still, which is why we’re broadening \\nthe brand’s appeal with new ranges – \\nF&F Couture and F&F Jewellery. Customers can buy a CD, \\nDVD or game and a film or \\nalbum download, all in one \\ntransaction. From the outset  \\nthe new site has proved popular \\nwith customers. We are also bringing global scale \\nand skill to our non-food business. With an integrated multichannel \\napproach we’re making it easy for \\ncustomers, whichever way they \\nwant to shop. In entertainment products, we’re \\nreducing prices and differentiating \\nour range by signing deals directly \\nwith film studios. This year we \\nsigned a groundbreaking deal with \\nDreamWorks for the exclusive \\nrights to the short animated film \\nMerry Madagascar, which sold over \\none million copies over Christmas. In some areas, such as electricals, \\ncustomers are looking for specialist, \\nimpartial advice. It \\ncontinues to grow strongly – last year  \\nwe delivered over one billion items. Tesco Direct extends the reach of  \\nour non-food offer with over 15,500 \\nproducts available to customers via the \\ninternet and catalogues. Customers \\ncan choose to have goods delivered  \\nto their home or they can pick them up \\nat one of our 261 in-store Direct desks. Phone Shops \\nare transforming our ability to  \\nsell products that require an \\nassisted sale, particularly contract \\nmobile phones. dunnhumby\\nThis year marks dunnhumby’s \\n20th anniversary. dunnhumby  \\nis growing fast – with profits  \\nup 28% in the year. dunnhumby \\nnow touches the lives of over \\n350\\xa0million consumers through  \\nits client relationships. Bad debt levels rose during the \\nyear but have now stabilised and \\nthroughout have remained below \\nindustry averages. Once again we have donated \\nthe equivalent of more than 1%  \\nof our profits to good causes. We have continued to roll out \\nCommunity Champions right \\nacross the Group. Community \\nChampions are staff members \\nwho dedicate paid hours to \\ncoordinate store activities in their \\nlocal communities. The Champions \\nsupport local charities, organisations, \\nschools and causes that local people \\nreally care about. We now have \\nChampions in seven countries. This year we \\nsucceeded in getting 6.2 million \\npeople active across the world. Creating good jobs and careers\\nWe are dedicated to creating \\ngood jobs wherever we are. We are committed to being a \\nresponsible neighbour within \\nour local communities and \\ntaking a leadership role on the \\nenvironment. This is something \\nour customers expect and  \\nwe believe is increasingly \\nimportant for our growth. We have delivered on our promise \\nto divert 100% of store waste in the \\nUK from going directly to landfill. The SCI aims to answer some  \\nof the fundamental questions \\nabout how to make a consumer \\nsociety sustainable. We \\nfocused on our core rates and  \\nin a tough financial year our pay \\ncompetitiveness improved in  \\nmost markets. In Malaysia, for \\nexample, where there is no legal \\nminimum wage, the minimum a \\nTesco employee will receive is \\n30% more than the Poverty Line \\nIndex. In Thailand this year we \\nintroduced a staff discount linked \\nto Clubcard. In the UK, our reward package \\nleads the market on pay and \\nbenefits. We are committed to providing \\nopportunities for our people  \\nto get on and turn their jobs  \\ninto careers. Last year we had \\nmore people on development \\nprogrammes than ever before. The first 17 students to complete \\nthe Tesco Foundation Degree \\ngraduated in July. We have now have 60 people on \\nthe scheme and are working on \\nways to make it grow. We believe that even in difficult \\ntimes it is essential to invest in \\nfuture talent. We now have 480 people at \\nDirector level in the business. We also understand the importance \\nof increasing mobility. The new Academy will help  \\nensure that the development of \\nour people in Asia keeps pace with \\nthe rapidly growing business. Our Values are ‘No-one tries \\nharder for customers’ and  \\n‘We treat people how we like  \\nto be treated’. These values  \\nare interlinked and underpin \\neverything we do at Tesco. We know that by managing  \\nour people well – in a culture  \\nof trust and respect – they  \\nwill in turn try their hardest  \\nfor customers. Our people are crucial to our \\nsuccess and it is essential that  \\nthey feel rewarded for the work \\nthey do and supported in their \\ndevelopment. The Group also provides retail banking and insurance services through its subsidiary  \\nTesco Bank. The summary of the Group financials is on pages 26 to 28.

The quality\\nmanagement systems of its UK operation\\nhave been certified as meeting the\\nrequirement of IS0 9002. Focus is on the large scale\\nproduction of raw materials for the medical diagnostics industry. Our product portfolio consists of \\nover 80 enzymes and biochemicals. Seravac is an approved supplier for all its\\nmain customers and is ISO 9001:2000\\ncompliant. The company is currently in\\nthe process of obtaining registration with\\nthe US FDA for Good Manufacturing\\nPractice. Seravac is also in the final\\nstages of obtaining viral validations\\ncertificates for certain enzymes. It has also extended \\nthe range of products with therapeutic\\npotential. At the same time we\\nwere able to redeem the Company’s\\noutstanding Preference shares. Applet will initially\\ndevelop therapeutics using the enzyme\\nhyaluronidase for use as an anti-oedema\\nand anti-inflammatory agent in the\\nprevention of transplant rejection. The commencement of these trials\\nwas temporarily delayed by an ethical review\\nrelating to patient informed consent which\\nhave now been resolved. It is now\\nanticipated that trial results will be\\navailable by the third quarter of 2005. Biozyme\\nproduces the active pharmaceutical\\ningredient, hyaluronidase, for Vitrase\\n®\\n. This approval enables ISTA to sell Vitrase\\n®\\nto ophthalmologists needing to facilitate\\nspreading of other drugs in the eye. I look\\nforward to the challenges ahead in\\nimproving profitability and seeking out\\nfurther appropriate opportunities. It is\\nalso used in pathology and organ function\\ntests. Other enzymes \\nfor which Biozyme holds a strong market\\nreputation include hyaluronidase,\\nribonuclease and urease. GMP compliance is necessary\\nfor the regulatory approval of therapeutic\\nproducts and/or their components. The company is engaged in the following\\nAPI programmes exploiting the enzymes \\nit produces for therapeutic applications. At year end the Group had invested\\n£0.1m. Applet is exploring the use of\\nhyaluronidase for its potential to reduce\\norgan transplant rejection. Applet\\nintends to take hyaluronidase through \\nthe pre-clinical stage and into phase I \\nand II clinical trials. Intellectual property\\ngenerated through the work will be owned\\nby Applet. Ophthalmic applications\\nThe Group supplies ISTA Pharmaceuticals\\nInc. with hyaluronidase for use in its drug\\nVitrase\\n®\\n. Vitrase\\n®\\nhas been approved by\\nthe US FDA for use as a spreading agent. In addition, Biozyme granted\\nISTA a technology licence to manufacture\\nhyaluronidase. This has clear benefits \\nto Biozyme freeing up its GMP facility \\nto pursue higher value projects. Sepsis and septic shock\\nAM-Pharma is a joint venture in which\\nTheratase holds approximately 9% of the\\nequity. The venture was established in\\n2001 to evaluate the role of alkaline\\nphosphatase in the treatment of sepsis\\nand septic shock. Alkaline phosphatase represents a potential\\nmajor market for AM-Pharma. The Phase I and IIa data obtained\\nto date in the small number of healthy\\nvolunteers indicate the product is safe and\\nwell tolerated. It is expected\\nthat clinical data from the Phase IIa study \\nin 50–60 patients could be available \\nin the second half of 2005. Amylase, Saccharase, and\\nMaltase <0.05%. Ratio of Glucose Oxidase to Catalase >2000. Although Seravac and Biozyme share\\nsome customers, there are few areas\\nwhere they are in direct competition. Seravac operates from a large\\nmanufacturing facility in Cape Town where \\nit employs around 60 staff. Customers include some of the world’s\\nleading diagnostic and pharmaceutical\\ncompanies. Seravac is an approved\\nsupplier for all its main customers and is\\nISO 9001: 2000 compliant. Seravac\\nmanufactures pharmaceutical and\\ndiagnostic enzymes. Its products may \\nbe split into two groups: animal derived\\nenzymes and plant derived enzymes. Animal derived enzymes\\nThis category includes various proteases,\\nwhich are enzymes extracted from bovine\\npancreas, and hyaluronidase, which is \\nan enzyme extracted from bovine or \\novine testes. The main products are\\ndeoxyribonuclease, chymotrypsin, \\nand chymotrypsinogen which are used \\nas anti-inflammatory agents as well as\\ndigestive aids. Integration of Seravac\\nIn the six months since acquisition\\nexcellent progress has been made in\\nintegrating Seravac into the Group. The\\noperations of Seravac USA have been\\ncombined with those of Biozyme’s US\\noperations, and Seravac’s US office \\nhas been closed. Some management\\nchanges have been made in Cape Town\\nto improve the management structure. Joint marketing initiatives have\\ncommenced and changes have been\\nmade to technical/marketing websites \\nto facilitate cross-selling. Used in the measurement of\\nglucose in colorimetric assays in conjunction with Peroxidase. For use as an enzyme\\nlabel, e.g. in ELISA systems. End User Benefits\\nControl and management at home of blood glucose levels in diabetics. These yield enhancements \\nhave already assisted in achieving an\\nimprovement in Seravac’s margins. Scope remains for further improvements\\nand joint programmes are continuing \\nto address both yields and also other\\nopportunities for joint product ventures. Opportunities to rationalise the production\\nand sale of some products and to\\nimprove the utilisation of plant are being\\nprogressed. Similarly Biozyme is assisting Seravac to\\nincrease sales of its products in Europe. Corporate social responsibility\\nTheratase is committed to conducting\\nbusiness in an ethical and socially\\nresponsible manner. We are\\ncommitted to giving equal opportunities \\nto all groups of people irrespective of\\nbackground. Our aim is to recruit the best\\nstaff in the industry and we believe in\\nmaximising every employee’s potential. We encourage in-house training and\\nsupport staff in further studies where\\nappropriate. Seravac’s purpose built\\nfacility provides a capacity potential not matched by competitors. The Board recognises and\\naccepts that concern for the environment\\nand all employees is an integral and\\nfundamental part of our corporate\\nbusiness strategy. Biozyme is committed\\nto preventing pollution and is certified to\\nthe Welsh Green Dragon Environmental\\nStandard. Processes have been set up\\nto identify and control potential pollution\\nthreats from its activities and products. Charitable donations and political\\ncontributions\\nThe Group believes that the choice \\nof charitable donations is a matter of\\nconscience for individual staff and\\nshareholders. The Group supports staff\\nwho volunteer their services to charitable\\nactivities. The Group’s policy is not to\\nmake any donations or to otherwise\\nsupport any political party or organisation. Seravac contributed\\n£2.3m of turnover in the six months since\\nacquisition. Glucose oxidase sales,\\nparticularly to Lifescan Europe, have\\nstrengthened in line with expectations. Profit after tax\\namounted to £1.1m (2003: £1.5m). The main markets are in the Far East and Europe. •Used in the structural analysis of DNA. •Treatment of empyema, meningitis, cystitis, acute mastitis, breast abscess,\\ntuberculous abscess, intra-peritoneal abscess, systemic lupus erythematosus. •HIV gene therapy. •Allogenic or autologous hematopoetic cell transplantation. •Botulinum toxin screening in food products. Earnings per share and dividend\\nBasic earnings per share for the year \\nwere 3.02p per share (2003: 4.54p). The Preference \\nshares were then redeemed in total \\nat a discount of £237,000. Details of\\nthese transactions can be found in \\nthe Directors’ Report on page 14. 8,657,318 shares were placed with new\\nand existing shareholders at 51p raising\\n£3.9m net of expenses. At year end, £1.4m of the revolving credit\\nfacility remained undrawn. The interest \\non the term loan is fixed at 7.055%. The interest rate on the revolving credit\\nfacility is set at 2% above LIBOR. Net assets have\\nincreased to £4.8m (2003: £2.5m). The average US\\ndollar rate this year was 12.2% less\\nfavourable than in the previous year. Both net\\ncash inflow and debtors at year end \\nhave been affected by the timing of \\nsales which were heavily skewed \\ntowards the end of the financial year. Implementing these changes will be a\\nsignificant exercise, and as a result, we\\nare undertaking a careful review of the\\nnew requirements. In addition, \\na new therapeutic programme has\\ncommenced. Seven isoenzymes have been extensively purified from horseradish. Applications\\n• In conjunction with glucose oxidase, it is used to monitor glucose levels in diabetic\\npatients. • A general indicator enzyme which can be used in neural mapping and in\\nimmunodiagnostics for the detection of numerous diseases. He has worked in a\\nvariety of technology industries including\\ntelecommunications, software distribution\\nand computer services. He joined the Board as\\nFinance Director in August 1999. A PhD Biochemist, Alan Aikman has\\nworked in the healthcare sector for over\\n30 years. Seravac was\\nsubsequently acquired by the Group \\nin April 2004. In 1996 she was appointed\\nGroup Legal Adviser and became Group\\nCompany Secretary in 1997. She was\\nappointed to the Board as Administration\\nDirector in March 1999. Business review and future developments\\nA review of the developments and activities of the Group \\nis contained in the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief\\nExecutive’s Review. A detailed financial review is set out in the Chief Executive’s\\nReview on pages 5 to 11. • The payment of a Preference dividend of 16p per Preference\\nshare amounting to £570,000 in total. • The payment of a Preference dividend of 8p per Preference\\nshare amounting to £284,000 in total. • The payment of a Preference dividend of 2.805p per\\nPreference share amounting to £16,213 in total. The Company seeks to abide by the payment terms agreed\\nwhenever it is satisfied that the goods or services have been\\nprovided in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. The Company does not apply a standard or code, which deals\\nspecifically with the payment of creditors. Charitable and political donations\\nNo donations were made during the year to charitable or\\npolitical organisations. Approved and signed by order of the Board. The Board of Directors\\nThe Board is responsible for the effective and proper\\nmanagement of the Group. The composition and biographies of the Board are set out \\non page 12. The Board currently comprises a Non-Executive\\nChairman, two Non-Executive Directors and three Executive\\nDirectors. There is a clear delineation of responsibility between\\nthe Chairman, the Chief Executive and other Executives. The Board has a schedule of matters specifically reserved \\nfor its decision. The Board meets formally at least every two months. Operational control is delegated\\nby the Board to the Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors\\nare able to contact the Executive Directors at any time for\\nfurther information. The Board is of the opinion that the Chairman and Dr Aikman\\nare independent of executive management and that there are\\nno relationships which could affect the independence of their\\njudgement. On appointment new Directors\\nare provided with appropriate training. All Directors are required to stand for re-election at the first Annual\\nGeneral Meeting following their appointment. Non-Executive Directors are appointed\\nfor a fixed term of a maximum of one year. The terms\\nand conditions are set out in their letter of appointment as\\ndetailed in the Remuneration Report. Non-Executive Directors do\\nnot participate in Company share incentive schemes and their\\nservice is non-pensionable. The Committee meets at least twice\\na year with the auditors in attendance. The Committee meets when\\nrequired to do so. Given the size of the Group the Board does not consider a\\nnomination committee appropriate. The Board also encourages the\\nparticipation of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The Company proposes separate resolutions at the Annual\\nGeneral Meeting for each substantially separate issue. All published information, including press releases, is available\\non the Theratase website www.theratase.com. It reviews the risk management\\nand control processes and reports to the Board. Compliance including: compliance with Listing Rules,\\nDirector’s duties, and general regulatory\\ncompliance. Production including: development, production and\\nquality assurance. Communication including: communication, information\\ntechnology and website. This reflects the current size of the Group. Certain parts of this report are required to be audited. Where such disclosures are subject to audit, they have been\\nmarked as such. Mr Percival is also\\nChairman of the Board. The Committee has not appointed nor sought advice from any\\nconsultants to advise on remuneration issues, however legal\\nadvice on such matters has been provided to the Committee\\nduring the period. The Committee meets usually at least twice a year. Short term incentives – performance bonus\\nThe Executive Directors are entitled to an annual discretionary\\nbonus under the Executive Directors’ Bonus Scheme. The\\nannual bonus is set at a percentage of base salary on a sliding\\nscale. Bonuses are earned on the achievement of gross margin\\nbased on forecast. Share incentive schemes\\nThe Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme. Options may be exercised between the first and\\nseventh anniversary of the date of grant. The exercise price \\nof an option is not less than the mid market price of an\\nOrdinary share on the dealing day preceding the date of grant \\nof the options. No performance criteria are imposed for\\nexercising options. The Committee has recently reviewed and taken advice on\\npossible replacement share incentive schemes. Executive Directors\\nand the Executive Chairman of Seravac are entitled to a\\ncompany car or a car allowance. Pensionable earnings do not include elements of remuneration\\nother than salary. Directors’ service contracts\\nExecutive Directors each have a service contract of indefinite\\nduration until normal retirement age. The Committee’s policy for provision for compensation for \\nloss of office is to provide compensation which reflects the\\nCompany’s contractual obligations. The Committee allow the Executive Directors to accept\\nNon-Executive Director appointments with other companies. Any appointment is subject to Board approval. Non-Executive Directors\\nThe remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined \\nby the Board, in which matter the Non-Executive Directors play\\nno part. The Board takes into account the Independent Director\\nSurvey published by Independent Remuneration Solutions in\\nconsidering the Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration. On 13 August 2004 the Chief Executive exercised 10,000 options at an exercise price of 14p and Mr Anderson exercised 10,000\\noptions at an exercise price of 25.5p yielding notional pre-tax gains of £2,050 and £900 respectively. No other Directors exercised\\nshare options during the year. These indices have been\\nchosen as they are considered to be the most appropriate comparator groups available for the Company. They have general responsibility for taking such steps \\nas are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the\\nGroup and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. We have also audited the information in the Directors’\\nRemuneration Report that is described as having been audited. Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors\\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report\\nand the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if we\\nbecome aware of any apparent misstatements or material\\ninconsistencies with the financial statements. Basis of audit opinion\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards\\nissued by the Auditing Practices Board. Basis of preparation\\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost accounting rules. The financial statements have also been\\nprepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards. The financial statements of all subsidiary undertakings are co-terminous with those of Theratase plc. Subsidiary undertakings\\nThe acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. On consolidation the difference between the nominal value \\nof the consideration shares and their fair value is taken to merger reserve. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 October 1998 was written off directly against reserves on acquisition. Future instalments under such\\narrangements, net of finance charges, are included within creditors. All other leases are accounted for as “operating leases” and the rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line\\nbasis over the life of the lease. Pension costs\\nThe Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group. The scheme has been discontinued and is in the process of being wound up. No contributions have been\\nmade since March 1996. Costs are\\nassessed using the projected unit credit method. Research and development expenditure\\nThe cost of fixed assets acquired to provide facilities for research and development activities is capitalised as tangible fixed assets\\nand depreciated over the expected useful economic life of the asset concerned. Research and development expenditure is written \\noff against profits in the year in which it is incurred. Grants\\nRevenue based grants are credited to the profit and loss account so as to match them with the expenditure towards which they are\\nintended to contribute. Stocks\\nStocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Employee share schemes\\nThe cost of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares is recognised over the period to which the award\\nrelates. The profit and\\nloss accounts of such undertakings are consolidated at the average rate during the year. Tax services include corporate tax compliance, tax planning and advice. The balance was charged to the profit and loss account. In South Africa an\\nadditional tax of 14% is levied on dividends paid to overseas companies.
